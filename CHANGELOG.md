# Changelog

All notable changes to JWC are documented here. This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.9.951] — the queue had no ceiling — 2026-09-09

### Added

- **`server { job_max_payload }`** (default 65536) and **`server
  { job_queue_limit }`** (default 10000), with `JWC_JOB_MAX_PAYLOAD` and
  `JWC_JOB_QUEUE_LIMIT` overriding them in a native build. `0` disables
  either, as it does for `max_sockets` and `max_body_bytes`.

### Fixed

- **Nothing bounded what a `dispatch` could write, or how much of it.**
  A job payload is built from request data and then *sits in a table*.
  `max_body_bytes` bounds the request and bounded nothing about what a
  handler carried out of one into the queue, and no limit existed on how
  many rows accumulated. Measured against a queue with no workers
  draining it, at the 1 MB default body cap: **twenty requests put 20 MB**
  of incompressible payload into `_jwc_jobs`. That storage is durable and
  shared with every other table — a full database is every query failing,
  not only the jobs.

  jobs.md §2.2 already refuses `dispatch` from inside a job body on
  exactly this argument ("no bound on the work it creates") and left the
  request path open.

  Both refusals are faults: the detail goes to the log, the caller gets
  the ordinary `internal_error`, and the request's transaction rolls back.
  Deliberately not a silent drop — §3.2 rules out a queue that can lose a
  job invisibly, and dropping an enqueue at a limit is that same loss on a
  different line. The depth test runs **inside** the insert, because
  counting first and inserting second lets two requests both see room and
  both take it.

Measured on both backends: a 1 MB payload refused with **zero** rows
written where twenty of them had written 20 MB; `job_queue_limit = 5`
admitting exactly five, refusing the sixth, and accepting again as the
queue drained. Two phases in `jobs_queue`, both of which fail without the
change — one on the payload, one on the ceiling being off by one.

### Docs

- **ROADMAP §7 still deferred two things that ship.** `DEFERRED.md` had
  struck through `DEFERRED-2` (the AOT backend) and `DEFERRED-16` (jobs,
  the durable queue, the dead-letter table, WebSocket) with reasons, and
  §7 — which four spec pages link to by name — went on listing both as
  absent: that `jwc build` produces only a launcher and answers `E0910` to
  a `--native` flag, and that the language cannot declare a `job`. The
  first names a flag and an error code that have never existed; the second
  is four sections of `jobs.md`. Four other lines in ROADMAP still carried
  `E0910` in "still open" lists.

  §7 is now a view over the register: every row opens with its
  `DEFERRED-N`, the two withdrawals are recorded in a new §7.1 rather than
  deleted, and SSE — the one part of `DEFERRED-16` that really is absent —
  gets its own row under `DEFERRED-19`.

- **Two spec cross-references pointed at the wrong thing.** `routing.md`
  cited `DEFERRED-17` for Server-Sent Events, but `DEFERRED-17` is
  sequences as a declared object class; SSE is `DEFERRED-19`. And
  `DEFERRED-9` explained itself with "queues are ROADMAP §7", which stopped
  being true when the queue shipped — the language surface is what stays
  deferred, and the runtime's own claim uses `SKIP LOCKED` (jobs §3.3).

- **A guard, because a banner was not one.** ROADMAP already carried a
  note at the top saying every `--native` clause below it was stale; a
  reader arriving at §7 from `writes.md §6` never sees line 3. Two rules
  now hold: naming a withdrawn id requires saying it was withdrawn, and
  every §7 row must open with a live id. The second is the one that
  matters — §7's rows carried no ids at all, so no citation check could
  have caught them going stale.

## [0.9.950] — a dead peer kept its slot — 2026-09-08

### Added

- **`server { socket_keepalive }`** — a keepalive ping on quiet WebSocket
  connections, default `"30s"`, `"0s"` to disable. Both backends;
  `JWC_SOCKET_KEEPALIVE` overrides it in a native build.

### Fixed

- **`max_sockets` could not reclaim a connection that was open but dead.**
  A cap on how many connections may be open bounds nothing about how long
  a dead one stays open: `socket.recv()` waits with no timeout, so a peer
  that vanished without a FIN — a lid closed, a NAT entry expired, a cable
  pulled — held its slot until the kernel gave up on the TCP connection,
  which for an idle socket is never. The cap then worked against the
  server, refusing live clients on behalf of peers that no longer existed.
  routing.md §9.5 described this gap in as many words and left it for a
  later version.

  A quiet connection is now pinged every interval; if the next tick finds
  that ping still unanswered, the peer is gone and the connection is
  dropped, returning its slot. Any frame counts as the answer, not only a
  pong, so a busy socket is never disturbed.

Measured on both backends with a 2s interval, against a peer that
completes the handshake and then never writes another byte: `ping` at 2s,
`close` at 4s. With `max_sockets = 2`, two such peers filled the cap and a
third upgrade got **503**; once the deadline passed, the same upgrade
succeeded. A peer that answered its pings was still connected after five
of them. With the ping disabled, the same dead peer was never touched —
which is what the escape hatch is for.

## [0.9.949] — headers, and a fault that told the caller too much — 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- **A fault's detail reached the client on the native backend, with
  `JWC_DEBUG_ERRORS` off.** `jwc_thrown_response` sent the message of an
  `internal_error` verbatim, so `mail.send` against an unconfigured relay
  answered the caller with the names of every `JWC_SMTP_*` variable, and
  the transport arm below it handed over whatever the relay said — where
  the host, the account and the rejection reason live. errors §63,
  routing §203 and security §6.3 all fix that answer at
  `{"error":"internal_error"}` with the detail in the log. Redaction now
  happens where a raise becomes a response rather than at each raise site,
  so the next `internal_error` anyone adds is covered without being
  remembered.

- **`JWC_DEBUG_ERRORS` did nothing under `jwc serve`.** It is in the config
  registry, `jwc config` prints it, and the generated crate honoured it —
  and the backend a developer is actually running when they reach for it
  never read the variable. The switch now moves both backends, off the same
  truthy set, read once.

- **The two backends sent different bodies for the same fault.** `jwc build`
  answered with a sentence of English ("Internal server error. Check the
  server log…") where `jwc serve` answered `internal_error`, so a client
  could tell which backend it was talking to from the outside. Both now
  send `{"error":"internal_error"}`, and both send the full detail when the
  switch is on.

Measured on one route that faults, over both backends, in both modes:
identical bodies, and the detail in the log either way.

### Also fixed — `set_header` set nothing; `add_header` added once

Both header verbs an `after` block has were wrong, in opposite directions,
one on each backend — so a single measurement of one two-line middleware
disagreed with itself twice.

### Fixed

- **`response.set_header` appended instead of replacing (interpreter).**
  `exec_call.rs` matched `"response.set_header" | "response.add_header"` in
  one arm and pushed onto the header bag, so `set` was `add`. A route that
  set `Cache-Control` after middleware had already set it answered with the
  header **twice**, and a client picking the first one got the value the
  author had meant to override. The two names are now told apart before
  queueing, and `set_header` drops the earlier write of the same name.

- **`response.add_header` kept only the last value (native).**
  The builtin itself was right — it pushed. `jwc_response_with_headers`
  then merged the whole bag into the response object's `headers` **map**,
  where one name holds one value, so every repeat collapsed. Two
  `add_header("X-Add", …)` calls sent one header under `jwc build` and two
  under `jwc serve`; a `Set-Cookie` written from an `after` block was lost
  outright. `after` headers now travel in a list of their own, the way
  `cookie(...)` already did, and reach the wire with their order and their
  repeats intact.

Measured with a two-`set` two-`add` `after` block over both backends: the
answers are now byte-identical, and `x-add` appears twice on each.

The rule the two halves broke is stated for the security headers in config
§3.9.4 — the backends may not hold separate opinions about the header
table. It is now stated for these two as well (middleware §5.4.1–§5.4.3),
because neither `set_header` nor `add_header` had a normative sentence
saying what it does; the names were the only specification, and the code
disagreed with them on both sides.

## [0.9.948] — `raw()` holds; the ring around it did not — 2026-08-28

`raw()` itself is sound and was attacked to establish that. Six payloads
through a live Postgres with `JWC_LOG_SQL` on — `' OR 1=1 --`, a `UNION
SELECT` of a `private` column, a stacked `DROP TABLE`, `{}` as data, `$1`
as data — produced a **byte-identical SQL string** every time, with only
the bind length changing. Five ways of laundering caller data into the
template (concatenation, a local, a helper function returning `text`,
`string.of`, arity mismatch) are all `E0610` at compile time, and
`run_raw` re-asserts the literal on the AST before touching the database,
so the checker is not the only gate. Identifier position is not
injectable: `{}` lowers to `($n::text)` and can only ever be a value.

The defects were in the ring around it.

### Fixed

- **`http.json` spliced an unvalidated remote body into the response.**
  The value became `Raw`, which splices without re-encoding, so a remote
  returning the bytes `1, "admin": true, "role": "owner"` turned
  `json({ ok: true, remote: http.json($u) })` into

      {"ok":true,"remote":1, "admin": true, "role": "owner"}

  — valid JSON carrying two top-level fields the program never wrote.
  `json.parse`, ten lines away, has always parsed and re-serialised; now
  `http.json` does the same and raises `BadRequest` when the body is not
  JSON. This does not need a hostile server: `http.*` deliberately does
  not raise on a non-2xx, so an upstream proxy's HTML error page reached
  the same line. Fixed on both backends.

- **`transient` — the remedy the compiler itself recommends — answered
  500 on every request.** `E0305`'s help text says "mark the field
  `transient`, or drop it at the site with `except (z)`". Measured with
  `class C { z text transient; a text; b text; }`: the first produced
  `{"error":"internal_error"}` and `[fault] expected 2 parameters but got
  3`, while the second returned 201. The compiler was recommending the
  broken one.

  `write_fields` builds names and values as parallel vectors; `sql::insert`
  skips a name the table has no column for — which is exactly what
  `transient` means — and left the value behind, so the driver got one
  bind too many. The value is now dropped with its name, in
  `run_insert`, where the two vectors are still the single thing they are
  meant to be. Both remedies now return 201 and neither writes the
  transient field.

### Documented

- **`raw()` returns a `private` column**, and schema.md promised
  otherwise in an unqualified line — "`private` | never in a response".
  The guarantee is the query compiler's: a compiled `select` omits the
  column, a hand-written one returns it, with no diagnostic. Both §3.1 and
  the attribute table now say whose guarantee it is, and point at
  `jwc explain`'s `raw()` count as the list to read before believing a
  schema's `private` columns are unreachable.

- **`raw(…) as { id, total }`** — the form writes.md §6 opened with — does
  not parse (`E0001: expected ';', found 'as'`), and never has: the
  grammar has `as { }` only inside a `select`. The fence was marked
  `jwc no-compile`, so the docs test never ran it. §6 now shows the form
  that works and §6.3 says a `raw` result is `Raw`, with the reason an
  annotation would be a shape taken on trust.

### Known, not fixed

`'{}'` inside raw SQL is consumed as a placeholder, so `'{}'::jsonb` and
`tags = '{}'` are unwritable through `raw()`. It fails loudly (`E0610`, or
a Postgres type error) rather than silently. `JWC_DEBUG_ERRORS` is in the
env registry and read only by the native prelude — `jwc serve` ignores it,
which fails closed but makes the registry's "single source of truth" claim
untrue for that row.

## [0.9.947] — four ways a cookie went missing — 2026-08-28

`cookie(...)` itself holds: every injection attempt against its name,
value, `path` and `domain` is refused with a readable fault, `HttpOnly`
and `SameSite=Lax` really are the defaults, and `same_site: "None"`
really does force `Secure`. The defects were all in the ring around it.

### Fixed

- **`with { "Set-Cookie": … }` deleted a cookie instead of setting one.**
  `with { }` replaces on header name, and `Set-Cookie` is the one header
  HTTP expects to repeat, so replacing on it throws away a cookie the
  author set on purpose. Measured:
  `created(json({…}) cookie("sid","inner")) with { "Set-Cookie": "outer=1" }`
  answered `set-cookie: outer=1` alone — the validated
  `Path=/; SameSite=Lax; HttpOnly` session cookie gone, no diagnostic
  anywhere, while the same expression over `Cache-Control` kept it.
  `Set-Cookie` now appends; every other header still replaces.

- **A duplicated request header overwrote, and one bad byte deleted it.**
  Both measured on `Cookie:`. Two `Cookie:` fields arrived as the second
  one alone; `Cookie: a=\xff` read as *no cookie header at all*. Neither
  is exotic — RFC 9113 §8.2.3 lets an HTTP/2 client split the cookie list
  across fields and browsers do, and one high byte anywhere on the domain
  was a silent, persistent logout. Repeats are now joined (`; ` for
  `Cookie` per the cookie grammar, `, ` elsewhere per RFC 9110 §5.3) and a
  non-UTF-8 byte is replaced rather than discarding the header.

- **A CR or LF in a header value produced a naked 500.** No body, no
  request id, and none of the three security headers — while config.md
  §3.9.3 promises them on **every** answer including a fault. Reachable
  from a query string through `with { }`. No header injection occurs
  (hyper refuses the value, which is the part that matters), but the
  answer that went out was stripped and nothing was logged. It is now the
  ordinary fault envelope, built from parts that cannot themselves be
  rejected, with a log line naming the likely cause.

  The comment on that branch said it was "only reachable if a header value
  the program produced is not a legal header value — which `Response`
  already normalises." `Response` normalises nothing. Both halves of the
  sentence were wrong.

- **`__Host-` and `__Secure-` cookie names were unchecked (`E0746`).**
  `cookie("__Host-sid", "v", { path: "/admin", domain: "example.com" })`
  and a bare `__Secure-` cookie both checked clean and both are refused
  outright by every current browser. That is the same silent failure
  `E0739` exists for, and an author reaching for a prefix is an author
  trying to be careful. Both prefixes now require `secure: true`, and
  `__Host-` also requires `path: "/"` and no `domain`. A correctly formed
  prefixed cookie still passes — the rule is a filter, not a wall.

### Still open, named rather than quietly carried

`with { }` and `response.set_header` can still write a `Set-Cookie` with
none of `cookie(...)`'s defaults and no diagnostic; `response.set_header`
appends where the native prelude's version replaces, so the two backends
disagree; and JWC has no session facility, so a cookie value carries no
integrity of its own. These are design questions, not one-line repairs,
and they are listed here rather than left for the next reader to
rediscover.

## [0.9.946] — one host could take the whole server down — 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- **Nothing bounded how many WebSocket connections could be open**, and a
  single host could use that to stop the server answering HTTP at all.

  Measured, against a server whose descriptor limit was 200: an attacker
  opened **190** connections, sent nothing on any of them, and every
  ordinary HTTP request then failed to connect — not a 503, not a slow
  answer, no connection at all. `/healthz` and `/readyz` are HTTP too, so
  an orchestrator would see a dead pod, restart it, and hand the attacker
  a fresh one to refill. Each connection cost about **14.7 kB** and
  exactly one descriptor, 1000 of them were accepted without complaint,
  and after fifteen idle seconds all 1000 were still open — nothing closes
  a connection that says nothing, because `socket.recv()` waits with no
  timeout.

  `server { max_sockets }` now bounds it. Past the cap the upgrade is a
  **503 answered before the handshake**, so the descriptor is never spent
  and the client gets a status it can read rather than a 101 followed by a
  close. The same 190 attempts now fill the cap, the rest are refused, and
  HTTP keeps answering 200.

  The default is **half the process's own descriptor limit, clamped to
  [64, 4096]**, not a fixed number. A fixed 1024 would have been actively
  wrong: 1024 is the common Linux soft limit, so the default would have
  permitted sockets to take every descriptor the process had — the exact
  failure the cap exists to stop.

- **The native backend ignored `server { max_body_bytes }` entirely.**
  Found while wiring the cap into both backends. Same source, same
  program, no environment variable: `jwc serve` answered **413** to a
  5000-byte body against a declared 1024-byte limit, and a `jwc build`
  binary answered **200**. The prelude read only `JWC_MAX_BODY_BYTES` and
  fell through to a hardcoded 2 MiB, so the number in the source reached
  one backend and not the other.

  Codegen now emits the source value into the generated crate and the
  prelude falls back to it. The environment variable still wins, because
  an operator has to be able to change a limit without a rebuild. This
  also repairs 0.9.944's socket message cap on native builds, which was
  reading the same env-only path.

### Known limit, stated rather than implied

The cap does **not** reclaim a connection that is open but dead. Without a
server-initiated ping and a pong deadline there is no way to tell a quiet
peer from a departed one, and 1.0 sends no ping. An attacker holding slots
open still denies *sockets* to everyone else; what the cap guarantees is
that **HTTP survives it**. routing.md §9.5 says so in those words.

### Tests

- `the_number_of_open_sockets_is_capped` drives a real server: exactly the
  cap is admitted, everything past it is a readable 503, HTTP answers 200
  throughout, and a closed connection returns its slot. Confirmed to fail
  without the fix (24 admitted where 8 is the cap).
- The connection counter moved from a process-wide `static` onto
  `Program`, which is where it belongs — the cap is a property of a
  server, not of a process. As a static it was also quietly wrong under
  test: two servers in one binary shared a budget neither declared, and
  the symptom was a cap that admitted one fewer than it said.

## [0.9.945] — the operational paths, stated — 2026-08-28

### Documented

- **`/healthz`, `/readyz` and `/metrics` are unauthenticated**, and the
  spec had not said so. §4.0.2 explained why they are *not declarable*,
  which is a different claim: a reader could finish that paragraph without
  learning the paths are open to anyone who can reach the listener. Now
  config §4.0.7 and security §8.4 say it outright, along with whose job it
  is — the operator's, at the ingress.

  The reason they stay open is in the same paragraph: a probe an operator
  must authenticate to is a probe that fails when the credential does, and
  middleware in front of `/healthz` makes liveness depend on the thing
  liveness watches.

### Verified, not changed

Four areas were attacked this round and three held. What held:

- **`static` mount traversal.** Ten payloads against a live mount —
  `../`, `%2e%2e/`, `%2e%2e%2f`, `....//`, `..%5c`, double-encoded
  `%252e%252e%252f`, and `sub/../../` — all 404. So did a **symlink
  inside the mount root pointing outside it**, which is the same class of
  bug as the tar unpack fixed in 0.9.943; here the canonical containment
  check in `assets::resolve` already caught it. The path is never
  percent-decoded before the check, so an encoded `..` stays a filename
  that does not exist.
- **CORS `origins = ["*"]` with `credentials = true`** is `E1207`, and it
  fires: the reflection bypass it exists to stop — answering `*` by
  echoing the caller's origin, which satisfies the browser and hands any
  site the authenticated responses — cannot be configured. `origins`
  accepts only literal strings, so `env()` cannot smuggle a `*` past the
  compile-time check.
- **`/readyz` discloses nothing.** Measured with a connection string
  carrying a user, password, internal hostname, port and database name,
  against an unreachable database: the answer is
  `{"status":"unready","failed":["db_uninitialised"]}` and none of the six
  appears in it.

## [0.9.944] — `max_body_bytes` now covers the socket — 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- **A WebSocket message ignored `server { max_body_bytes }`.** The cap is
  documented as the largest thing a peer may send, and it stopped at the
  HTTP body: the upgrade carried no limit of its own, so the real ceiling
  was the WebSocket library's 64 MiB default whatever the config said.

  Measured against a server configured for `max_body_bytes = 1024`: a
  **5,000,000** byte text frame was accepted, handled, and echoed —
  roughly 5000x the number in the file — and 64 MiB was where the
  connection finally died. An author who set the knob had not bought what
  it says.

  Both backends now apply it to the message *and* the frame. At 1024 the
  message is still delivered; at 1025 the connection closes and the
  handler does not run. The `0` escape hatch, for a deployment behind a
  proxy that enforces its own size, leaves the library default in place
  here too, exactly as it does for a body.

  The cap is per connection, so N peers still cost N x the cap. This is a
  bound on one message, not a memory budget, and §9.4 says so rather than
  leaving the reader to assume the stronger claim.

### Tests

- `tests/socket_limits.rs` drives a real server over a real socket and
  hand-rolls the frame, because the frame this test needs is one a client
  library would refuse to build. Confirmed to fail without the fix
  (`Echoed("len=1025")` where `Refused` is required) rather than only
  passing with it.

## [0.9.943] — the audit: what a package, a URL and a token can do — 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- **`jwc add` could be made to write outside its own directory.** The
  unpack refused an absolute path and a `..`, which is the rule everyone
  writes down, and it does not see the attack. Measured against the real
  `vendor` code: an archive carrying a **symlink** `escape` pointing at
  another directory, followed by an ordinary file `escape/hacked.txt`,
  wrote `hacked.txt` into that other directory. Neither entry's path is
  absolute and neither contains `..` — the escape is in the *link*, not
  in the name. `jwc add` runs on a developer's machine and in CI and the
  archive comes from whoever published the package, so this was an
  arbitrary file write from a publisher to everyone who installs.

  Symlinks and hard links are now refused **by entry type** rather than
  resolved, along with every other exotic type; the parent is
  canonicalised after the join and must be under the destination; and the
  archive may not unpack to more than 64 MiB, so a gzip bomb cannot fill
  the disk. Three tests, one of which hand-patches a `..` into a tar
  header because `tar::Builder` will not write one — a guard tested only
  against archives the friendly library agreed to produce is a guard
  tested against nothing.

- **`JWC_HTTP_BLOCK_PRIVATE` did not refuse `100.100.100.200`**, which is
  Alibaba Cloud's metadata endpoint. It is inside carrier-grade NAT
  (`100.64.0.0/10`) and in no RFC 1918 range, so a check written from
  memory misses it. Also added: `0.0.0.0/8` (which routes to the local
  host on Linux), `192.0.0.0/24`, `198.18.0.0/15`, `240.0.0.0/4`,
  broadcast, multicast, and **IPv4-mapped IPv6** — `::ffff:127.0.0.1` is
  a loopback address for which `Ipv6Addr::is_loopback` answers false.

  Measured as holding, and now pinned by a test: `0x7f000001`,
  `2130706433`, `0177.0.0.1` and `127.1` all normalise to `127.0.0.1`
  before the check sees them, and `http://allowed.example@evil.example/`
  has host `evil.example`.

- **`jwt.sign` signed `sub` and threw the rest of the claims away.**
  Measured: `jwt.sign({ sub: $id, role: "admin", org_id: 7 }, …)` minted
  `{"sub":"1","iat":…,"exp":…}` with no diagnostic anywhere. Inside JWC
  it was invisible, because `jwt.verify` answers a fixed three-field
  record either way — but a token exists to be read by something else,
  and every custom claim a service put in one was dropped on the way out.
  Both backends had it and both agreed, which is why nothing caught it.

  The whole record is signed now, with `iat` and `exp` supplied by the
  builder because that is what `ttl_minutes` decides. A first argument
  that is not a record is `E0303`; before this the rule was arity only,
  so `jwt.sign("a string", 5, "x")` typechecked.

### Verified, not changed

- **The JWT verifier holds.** Attacked live with `alg: none` in three
  spellings, a tampered payload, a payload re-signed with another secret,
  an `alg` swapped to `RS256`, an expired token with a valid signature, a
  future `nbf`, an empty signature and a two-segment token. Every one
  answers null. Reading a claim off that null without a guard is `E0320`,
  so there is no path from an unverified token to a claim.
- **The keyset cursor holds.** MAC over the version *and* the payload,
  constant-time compare, one answer for malformed and forged alike, and a
  short cursor binds NULL rather than shifting the tuple.
- The outbound guard refuses `file:`, refuses a URL with no host, and does
  not follow redirects.

## [0.9.942] — three things the source said and the code did not — 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- **routing.md §10.2 contradicted §4.3, and the mount lost.** §4.3 says
  the router picks the candidate with the **most literal segments**; §10.2
  put every `route` ahead of every `static` mount. A file under a mount is
  all-literal and a `{slot}` route has none, so the two rules disagreed
  about exactly the case where it matters. Measured on jwc-shortener,
  which declares `/{code}`: `GET /robots.txt` reached the redirect
  handler, found no such link, and answered **404 with "bunday havola
  yo'q"** — a wrong answer rather than a missing one — while
  `public/robots.txt` sat unread beside `index.html`. The same for
  `/favicon.ico`, `/sitemap.xml` and every other fixed crawler name.

  §10.2 now reads: an all-literal route, then the operational paths, then
  a mount, then a route that bound a path parameter. The mount only wins
  when it **holds** the file — a miss falls through, so `/abc123` still
  reaches `/{code}` — and a `POST` a route declares is the route's, not
  the mount's 405. Both backends take the same `only_hits` flag through
  the same lookup, so a native binary cannot keep the old order.

- **A bare `return;` in a middleware answered 204, silently.**
  middleware.md §4.2 lists three ways a middleware completes and this is
  none of them. Measured: `middleware RequireAuth { if (…) { return; } }`
  answered `204 No Content` to an unauthenticated caller — not a 401 —
  with `jwc check` reporting nothing. Two mistakes end there and neither
  shows in the source: an author who meant "reject" sends the wrong
  status, and one who meant "I am done, carry on" — what a bare `return`
  does in every language where middleware is a function — switches the
  endpoint off, because the route body never runs. Now `E0812`, naming
  all three fixes. A bare `return;` in an `after` block or a socket
  handler is a different body and stays legal.

- **`jwc fmt` had no line-width rule outside a query and an `insert`.**
  Measured: jwc-shortener's `robots.txt` route was a `string.join([...])`
  over 36 short strings and the formatter printed it as **one
  1608-column line** — a formatter that makes a file less readable than
  the input is one people stop running. An array, a record literal and an
  argument list now break one item per line when the one-line form passes
  92 columns at its indent, recursively, and the bracket hugs its call so
  `string.join([` … `], "\n")` reads the way a person writes it. A chain
  of one operator — `+`, `and`, `or` — breaks at its joints on the same
  rule. A ternary, a mixed chain and a long identifier chain still stay on
  one line, deliberately: breaking one is a claim about which half
  matters.

  An `insert`'s own width check was wrong in the same direction — it
  counted the head and the values and ignored both the indent and a
  ` catch Conflict (err) {` riding on the end, so jwc-shortener's insert
  printed at 96 columns. It measures the whole line now.

### Changed

- `jwc-shortener` serves `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` and `docs/index.html`
  from `public/` again instead of from four routes built out of
  `string.join([...])`. They gain an ETag, a 304 and `Cache-Control`; they
  lose `MetricsTracker`, because a mount takes no middleware (§10.1).

## [0.9.941] — `redirect` goes here, `redirectExternal` goes anywhere — 2026-08-28

`redirect(302, $url)` sent a caller wherever the value said. Measured: a
route reading `request.query("to")` answered
`location: https://evil.example`, with nothing checked. That is the
primitive behind a phishing link that starts on your domain and behind
stealing an OAuth code from a `redirect_uri`.

It is also, for a URL shortener, the entire product. The language cannot
tell those apart; the author can. So there are two builders now.
`redirect` goes to a path on **this** service and refuses anything that
can leave — a scheme, an authority, a protocol-relative `//host` or
`/\host`, or a target not rooted at `/`. `redirectExternal` is the same
builder without the restriction.

The name is the point. "Where can this service send someone off-site" is
now a question `grep` answers in one line, which reading every `redirect(`
could not settle.

A literal off-site target is `E0745` — a mistake the compiler sees rather
than one a request discovers. A value found at run time is a fault, 500,
with the target named in the log. A target carrying a control character or
a newline is refused by **both** builders: it cannot be a header value.

The classification is syntactic and needs no knowledge of this service's
own host, which behind a proxy it does not reliably have. The bypasses are
covered by construction: `//evil.example`, `/\evil.example` and
`\\evil.example` all leave, and a check that only looked for `http:` lets
every one of them through.

`jwc-shortener` says `redirectExternal` now, which is the correct answer
for a service whose job is to redirect anywhere — and the diff is the first
time its source has said so.

## [0.9.940] — the rest of the security pass — 2026-08-28

**`jwc build` dropped the program's `cors { }` block.** The native runtime
read `JWC_CORS_*` and nothing else, so a policy written in the source was
honoured by `jwc serve` and absent from the artefact anyone deploys.
Measured: the interpreter allowed the one declared origin and refused the
rest; the binary sent no CORS header at all. It failed closed, which is the
better direction, but it also meant an operator "fixing" the missing header
with `JWC_CORS_ORIGINS=*` would widen the policy past anything the program
said. Codegen bakes the block now, and the environment configures only what
the source left unsaid. Verified: both backends allow the same origin and
refuse the same one, and `JWC_CORS_ORIGINS=*` no longer reaches a program
that declared a block.

**`string.escape_html` and `string.escape_url`.** `html(body)` sends its
argument verbatim, which is right, and there was no way to make a value
safe to put in one — no escaper, no template engine, nothing. An author had
the choice between hand-rolling one out of `string.replace` chains, where
getting the `&` ordering wrong is a silent hole, and not escaping. Both
quote styles are covered, because which one closes an attribute is a
property of the markup and not of the value.

**`JWC_LOG_SQL=1` printed every bound parameter.** Switching the SQL log on
in production wrote passwords, session tokens and personal data into a file
that is collected and kept. A bind is positional and has no name, so it
cannot be filtered by name the way a framework filters a params hash. `=1`
now prints each parameter's **length**; `=values` prints the values and
warns at the first statement that it is doing so.

**A `pattern()` was compiled on every request**, on both backends, once per
patterned field — regex compilation being far dearer than matching. Not
ReDoS: the `regex` crate has no backtracking. Just waste that scales with
request rate, which is a shape an attacker picks. Compiled patterns are
kept now, behind a ceiling, because `string.matches` takes its pattern from
an argument a program may build from a request.

**security.md said CSRF was out of scope "because the API is
token-authenticated, not cookie-authenticated".** The language has a cookie
builder, so that was false, and a claim in a threat model that the language
contradicts is worse than no claim. §6.4 now says what the language does —
`HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Lax` by default, `same_site: "None"` requiring
`secure`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY` — and what it does not: no token
facility, no double-submit helper, no automatic `Origin` check. A gap,
stated as one.

Still open and reported rather than guessed at: `redirect(302, $url)`
validates nothing, which is the product for a shortener and a hole for a
login flow, and the language cannot tell them apart without the author
saying which.

## [0.9.939] — the cookie that carried none of its attributes — 2026-08-28

A security pass, measured against a running server rather than read off
the docs. Two things were badly wrong, one was a hole the compiler should
have refused, and one whole class of header was simply absent.

**`cookie(name, value, opts)` threw the options away.** routing.md §6.2
has documented `{ http_only: true, max_age: 3600 }` since 1.0, and the
interpreter evaluated that record and dropped it: every cookie was
`name=value; Path=/`. No `HttpOnly`, so any script on the page could read
a session; no `SameSite`, so the browser's own default was the only thing
between the site and CSRF; no `Secure`. An author who read the page and
wrote the safe thing got the unsafe cookie anyway, with nothing said.

`jwc build` meanwhile refused the program outright — "native build does
not cover `cookie(...)` yet" — so a service that sets a cookie could not
be built at all; and the native path that would have run put `Set-Cookie`
into a header **map**, where a second cookie overwrites the first.

All of it now runs through `src/cookie_core.rs.in`, included by the
interpreter and pasted into the generated crate. Defaults are `HttpOnly`
and `SameSite=Lax`; `http_only: false` is the opt-out. A name or value
that would split the response is a named fault with the cookie in the log
rather than the opaque 500 hyper used to produce. Unknown attribute is
`E0737`, a bad `same_site` is `E0738`, and `same_site: "None"` without
`secure: true` is `E0739` — a cookie the browser silently refuses to
store, which is the one failure no layer would otherwise report.

**No route response carried a security header.** Measured: `content-type`,
`x-request-id`, `content-length`, `date`. A `static` mount sent `nosniff`;
a route did not. `server { headers { … } }` now sets six, three on by
default (`nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`,
`Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`) and three opt-in
(HSTS, CSP, Permissions-Policy) because a wrong value there is worse than
none — an HSTS max-age sent by mistake cannot be withdrawn. They go on
every answer, including the ones no builder made: a 413 refused before the
chain, a preflight, a 404, a fault. A header the program set itself wins.

**`origins = ["*"]` with `credentials = true` is now `E1207`.** A browser
refuses the literal pair, but a server that answers `*` by *reflecting*
the caller's origin satisfies the browser and defeats the check — and
reflecting is what `jwc serve` did. Measured: `Origin: https://evil.example`
came back allowed, with credentials, and `jwc check` said nothing. The
native binary already refused the same pair at boot, so the two backends
disagreed about whether the program could exist.

What held up, tested by attacking a live server rather than by reading:
SQL injection through a typed `where`, through `raw()`, through a path
parameter and through a validated body field — tautology, statement
stacking and `DROP TABLE` all stored or matched as literal text, the table
intact, and the path parameter refused with a 400 before Postgres saw it.
`max_body_bytes` refused a 4 MB body with 413.

## [0.9.938] — the language on one page — 2026-08-28

`docs/docs/reference/language.md`: the whole language, in the order a
person reads, with the reason for each rule — 1 100 lines covering what
the agent guide's tables leave out, which is migrations, jobs, sockets,
packages, tests, the runtime and the ceilings.

Two reference pages now, and the difference is written on both: the agent
guide is the same ground **compressed**, for a context window; this one is
the same ground **explained**, for a person and for an agent with room to
spare. Neither is normative — `docs/spec/v1/` is.

Every ```` ```jwc ```` block on it type-checks, held by the test that
already did that for the agent guide, extended to both. It found one
mistake in the writing on its first run: `unique on (a, b)` is not the
syntax, `unique (a, b)` is.

Two claims were wrong and are fixed rather than softened: there is no
`jwc config --print` — it is `JWC_PRINT_CONFIG=1` at boot — and the
`server { }` key list was missing `shutdown_grace` and gave no defaults.

## [0.9.937] — the loop ceiling, and the three limits behind it — 2026-08-28

Asked to look at the interpreter's loop limit, measured all of them. Three
were wrong, and two of the three were ways to take a server down from one
request.

**A recursion aborted the process.** `MAX_DEPTH` counted expression nesting
and was set to 128, but a JWC call frame is a chain of boxed futures whose
poll costs the whole chain's depth — so the *machine* stack ran out first.
On tokio's default 2 MiB worker stack `jwc serve` answered a recursion 18
deep and died at **20**: `fatal runtime error: stack overflow, aborting`.
That is a process abort, so every other request in flight died with it.
`jwc run` did the same at ~100 on the main thread.

Two halves, both needed. The runtime now gives its threads a 64 MiB stack
(address space, committed as touched) and runs `jwc run`'s program on a
worker rather than on whatever stack the linker gave `main`; and a new
`MAX_CALL_DEPTH` of 128 is what a program reaches first, as a fault naming
the function. Measured after: 127 answers, 128 is a 500, 100 000 is a 500,
and the server keeps serving.

**`request_timeout` could not fire.** Everything a JWC loop body awaits is
ready, and awaiting a ready future does not yield to the scheduler — so a
loop that never finishes never returned `Pending` and the timeout never got
a turn. Measured: `request_timeout = "3s"` around `while (true) { i += 1; }`
did not fire at all, the client gave up at twenty seconds, and the worker
stayed pegged at 100% after it had disconnected. Both loops now yield every
1024 turns, on both backends. Measured after: **504 in 3.006s**, CPU
released. `request_timeout` is a bound on compute now, not only on I/O.

**A recursive function could not be built.** A generated `async fn` that
calls itself is `E0733: recursion in an async fn requires boxing`, reported
against `src/main.rs` of a crate the author never wrote. So every program
with a recursive function ran under `jwc serve` and failed `jwc build`.
Codegen finds the functions in a call cycle — direct and mutual — from the
same `wiring::callees` reader `explain --function` walks, and boxes those
calls and no others.

`MAX_DEPTH` went 128 → 512 so a runaway recursion reports the call rather
than the nesting. The ceilings are written down in config.md §6a, with the
measurements.

## [0.9.936] — `jwc fmt` was deleting comments — 2026-08-28

Running `jwc fmt` on `jwc-shortener` removed thirteen lines of comment
across three files and reported success.

`fmt` re-prints from the AST, and comments are carried by `Attached`,
which hangs on a declaration or a statement. Nothing else has one — so a
`--` written between the fields of a record literal, between the keys of
`server { }`, or in an `insert` value list was never in the tree to print.
The module doc said comments survive. They survive *where the AST carries
them*, which is not the same sentence, and the difference is the paragraph
explaining why a column is `int`.

The printer still cannot hold those. What it no longer does is lose them
quietly: `jwc fmt` lexes the comments out of the input, compares them
against what it is about to write, and leaves the file alone rather than
drop one — naming the comment and where it can live instead. Lexed and not
grepped, because `"a -- b"` is a string.

Known and not fixed: the printer has no line-width awareness for an array
or a record literal outside an `insert`. `string.join([…], "\n")` over
thirty-six elements comes back as one 1608-character line. `expr()`
returns a `String` with no indent context, which is the same structural
reason it cannot place a comment, so the two want the same fix.

## [0.9.935] — `jwc build` did not run the checker — 2026-08-28

Rewriting `jwc-shortener` against the 1.0 language, three more.

**`jwc build` shipped what `jwc check` refuses.** It tested
`has_parse_errors` and went straight to codegen, so every diagnostic past
the parser — every type error, every unknown name, every unresolved import
— was skipped on the one command that produces the artefact you deploy. A
five-error program built a release binary and ran it. Codegen does not need
the types to be right in order to emit something that happens to compile,
which is exactly why it cannot be the thing that decides. `build` now calls
`check` first, rather than carrying a second list of analyses to forget to
extend.

**`timestamptz + interval` was string concatenation on the native
backend.** types.md §12 gives `+` and `-` three overloads on timestamps.
The interpreter had all three; the native prelude had none. `-` panicked,
which is at least loud. `+` fell into `jwc_add`'s string arm and answered
`"2026-08-28T15:44:14ZPT720H"` — a wrong value, not reported, that only
becomes an error later and somewhere else. The arithmetic now lives in
`src/interval_core.rs.in`, included by `src/exec.rs` and pasted into the
generated crate, so there is one implementation instead of two. Reading a
duration also got stricter on both sides: `"P30"` is a `P` and then a
number that never said what of, and it used to come back as zero seconds.

**A native console binary bound a port.** The generated `main` called the
listener unconditionally with a port defaulting to 8080, so `jwc build` on
the `console.writeln` program from the docs produced a binary that printed
its output and then sat on a socket — or, on a machine already using 8080,
printed its output and then a bind error. A binary is a server when the
program declares routes or sockets, or when `serve(...)` ran; the port
static now starts at a sentinel so "never called" is expressible at all.
`jwc run` on the same source has returned when `main` does since 0.9.934.

The shortener rewrite is what walked into all three, and into
[a routing tension](docs/spec/v1/routing.md) that is *not* fixed here:
§10.2 answers a request from a `route` before a `static` mount, and a
`{slot}` route is a route — so `/{code}` swallows `/robots.txt` and
`/favicon.ico` from the mount beside `index.html`, while §4.3 one page
earlier says the router picks the candidate with the most literal segments.
Changing it changes which handler answers an existing program's request, so
it is written up and left for a decision rather than taken.

## [0.9.934] — three defects rewriting jwc-shortener walked into — 2026-08-28

**A vendored package collided with itself.** A namespace under
`jwc_packages/` was counted as local, so importing the package you had
vendored reported `E0203` against your own copy.

**An unknown call qualifier was not reported.** `foo.bar()` where `foo` is
neither a service, a package nor a builtin namespace type-checked and then
failed at runtime. Now `E0204`, naming the three things `foo` could have
been.

**`jwc run` did not serve.** A `main` that calls `serve(...)` ran `main`
and exited. `serve::declared_port` answers `Option<u16>` now — `None` when
`main` never asked to listen — and `run` serves when it did.

## [0.9.933] — `o.x = v` answered a different key order from each backend — 2026-08-28

Assigning to a field that does not exist yet appended it to a
`V::Object`, which serialises sorted, while the interpreter kept a
`Value::Record`, which serialises in order. The same program answered two
different JSON documents depending on the backend. `jwc_set_field_path`
keeps the record and appends.

Both fix attempts compiled and passed all 484 tests before either worked,
because nothing in CI compiles the preludes. The `native-build` job added
in 0.9.932 is what closes that.

## [0.9.932] — the rest of what the cutover took, and three things that shipped broken — 2026-08-28

**The else branch of a null test narrows** (types.md §6.6 rule 3):
`if (x == null) { … } else { x.field }` no longer reports `E0320` on the
branch where `x` cannot be null.

**`jwc build` could not compile its own `api` template.** Nothing in CI
had ever compiled a generated crate. The `native-build` job now builds the
compiler and then runs `jwc new` + `jwc build --release` for all four
templates, boots one, and curls `/healthz`.

**The AI agent guide, rewritten for 1.0** — every example in it now
type-checks, pinned by a test — plus a formatting page, and
`cargo update -p chacha20` for the yanked 0.10.1.

## [0.9.931] — the lost CLI flags, and the settings that did nothing — 2026-08-28

`--list-codes` and `--explain <code>`, backed by a catalogue `build.rs`
generates from `docs/spec/v1/*.md` — the spec is the definition, so there
is no second copy to drift. `jwc migrate list`, `jwc fmt --stdout`,
`jwc openapi --compact`, `jwc lint --json`, and the boot fence and config
table `serve` prints.

**Twelve settings did nothing.** Three were wired (`JWC_LOG_FORMAT`,
`JWC_SERVER_WORKERS`, `JWC_PRINT_CONFIG`, `JWC_HOME`), nine removed. The
registry and the code now check each other in both directions, so a row
that names nothing and a variable nobody documents are both test failures.

**`jwt.verify` crashed native builds on a bad token**, and
`jwt.verify_jwks` shipped, compiled, and could not be called from the
language — the fourth instance of that shape. Both backends now answer the
same `Record?`.

## [0.9.930] — four names for code that was already here — 2026-08-28

```jwc
route GET "" { return text("Hello, World!"); }
```

That is the program the owner wrote first, and `text` was not a name. Nor
was `html`, nor `hash.sha1`, nor `hash.md5`.

None of the four needed implementing. `src/hash.rs` computed sha1 and md5
already; the native prelude already defined `jwc_b_text`, `jwc_b_html`,
`jwc_b_sha1` and `jwc_b_md5` — I found out by *duplicating* two of them and
watching the generated crate refuse to compile with "defined multiple
times". What was missing was the name: an arm in the checker, an arm in the
interpreter, a row in codegen's mapping table.

That is the third time this shape has turned up in this series — the HTTP
prelude in 0.9.922, `src/jwks.rs`, and now these — so it is worth naming:
**code that ships, compiles, and cannot be called from the language.** The
cutover moved a front-end and left the runtime behind it whole, and nothing
checks that the two agree on what exists.

`text(s)` and `html(s)` are `content(mime, s)` with the media type filled
in, which is correct and three times as long to write for the two bodies
people actually send. A record body is `E0736`, the same code `content`
already used for the same mistake.

`hash.sha1` and `hash.md5` are for reading a checksum someone else
produced. Neither is what a password goes through — `hash.password` is —
and the docs row says so.

Checked on both backends: `Hello, World! [text/plain; charset=utf-8]`,
`<h1>salom</h1> [text/html; charset=utf-8]`, and the known-answer digests
for `"abc"`, identical from `jwc serve` and from the compiled binary.

## [0.9.929] — `const`, and writing a field — 2026-08-28

The last two of the four the grammar diff turned up.

```jwc
const PAGE_SIZE = 50;
const LIMITS = [10, 50, 100];

let o = { "a": 1, "b": { "c": 2 } };
o.a = PAGE_SIZE;
o.b.c = 20;
o.fresh = 1;          -- a key that was not there is added
```

### `const`

Top-level, read-only, one name for the whole program — two with one name is
`E0215`, the same ambiguity two tables with one name would be. A local of
the same name shadows it, the way a parameter shadows one.

The right-hand side is a **constant expression**: literals, operators,
`? :`, array and object literals, and other consts. Anything else is
`E0216`. A whitelist, not a list of forbidden things — a blacklist has to
name every way to reach the outside world and is wrong the moment one is
added, and the failure mode of this direction is a diagnostic rather than a
program that reads the database while it loads.

Neither backend initialises anything: the interpreter evaluates at the use,
codegen emits the expression where the name appears. There is no
initialisation order to get wrong because there is no initialisation.

### `x.field = v`

Nested (`o.b.c`) and creating (`o.fresh`). A JWC record is a list of pairs
rather than a reference, so the write rebuilds the spine — which is also
why writing a key that was not there adds it: there is no declared shape
here to violate, and that is what 0.9 did.

The native backend converts a `Record` to an `Object` on write, because
`Record` is the compact form a projection produces and its field list is
fixed. `{"a":10,"b":{"c":20},"fresh":30}` from the interpreter and from the
compiled binary, identically.

## [0.9.928] — `while`, and `x += 1` — 2026-08-28

Two things 0.9 had that the 1.0 front-end never grew. Neither was removed
by a decision anyone recorded: the redesign specified `for` and `=`, nobody
diffed the new grammar against the old one, and a loop that ends on a
condition simply had no spelling.

```jwc
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    i += 1;
}
```

### `while`

`break` and `continue` behave as they do in a `for`. The condition is a
boolean — `while (1)` is `E0371`, the code `if` already uses for the same
mistake, rather than a new number for an old rule.

**It is bounded, which 0.9's was not.** Ten million turns and the loop
raises. A condition that never goes false is a request that never answers
and a connection nobody can reclaim; the ceiling turns that into an error
naming the loop instead of a hang only visible from outside. The number is
`exec::MAX_WHILE_TURNS`, and codegen emits *that* constant into the
generated crate, so a runaway fails the same way in a built binary as it
does under `jwc serve` — a test asserts the emitted number is the
interpreter's.

### `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=`

Desugared in the parser: `x += 1` becomes `x = x + 1` before the AST
exists, so the checker, both backends and the formatter never learn a
second assignment form. Works on text too, because `+` does — `s += "b"`.

Checked on both backends with one program: `i=5 sum=12` and `n=3` from the
interpreter and from the compiled binary, identically.

## [0.9.927] — the `.env` nothing read — 2026-08-28

`jwc new` writes a `.env.example` whose first line says the runtime reads
these. Nothing did. `DATABASE_URL` in a `.env` was inert, the error said
`DATABASE_URL (or JWC_DATABASE_URL) is required for db access`, and the
only way through was to export it by hand — which the documentation showed
as `export DATABASE_URL=…`, a line that does not run on Windows.

So the documented path from `jwc new` to a running program did not exist.
Every test in this repository passed, because every one of them set the
variable the way CI does.

### It was worse than absent: it was half-present

A binary from `jwc build` **did** read a `.env`, and **did** assemble
`DATABASE_URL` from a `PG_*` block. `jwc serve` did neither. The same
project therefore worked when compiled and failed when interpreted — the
one thing this project promises never happens.

The two parsers also disagreed. The native one dropped surrounding quotes
on the floor (`DATABASE_URL="postgres://…"` kept its quotes), did not know
a leading `export `, and skipped a malformed line in silence.

### One parser, both backends

`src/dotenv_core.rs.in` — the CLI includes it, codegen pastes the same text
into the generated crate, the same arrangement `assets_core.rs.in` uses.
Verified by running one `.env` with an `export` line, a double-quoted
value, a single-quoted value and a broken line under `jwc run` and as a
built binary: identical output, identical warning, three identical values.

| | |
|---|---|
| `KEY=VALUE`, one per line | a leading `export ` is tolerated |
| `#` at line start | a comment; `#` inside a value stays in the value |
| `'…'` / `"…"` | stripped; nothing inside is interpreted |
| `$OTHER` | **not** expanded — a password containing `$` is a password |
| not `KEY=VALUE` | **warned on stderr**, not skipped in silence |
| already in the environment | **wins**; the file never overwrites it |

The last row is the one that makes it safe to ship: a container's
configuration is untouched by a file lying in the directory.

`jwc run app.jwc` names a file, so the `.env` is looked for beside it
rather than inside it.

### The guard, which is the actual fix

Two mechanical checks, because the defect was never in the loader — the
loader did not exist, and nothing could notice.

**`a_generated_env_example_names_nothing_that_is_never_read`.** Every
variable in a template's `.env.example` must be in `config::REGISTRY` or
read by that template's own sources with `env("NAME")`. It failed on its
first run: `templates/jobs` names `JWC_JOB_WORKERS`, which is real, and the
registry had `JWC_QUEUE_WORKERS`, which nothing reads.

**`every_env_var_the_code_reads_is_registered_and_the_other_way_round`.**
Both directions. It found eight variables the code reads that no registry
knew — `JWC_BIND_HOST`, `JWC_DEV`, `JWC_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECS`, `JWC_LOG_SQL`,
`JWC_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `JWC_SERVICE_NAME`, `JWC_REGISTRY`,
`JWC_REQUEST_BODY` — so they were absent from the boot table and from
`config.md`, discoverable only by reading the source. `JWC_OTLP_ENDPOINT`
is how tracing is turned on.

And thirteen the other way: registered, printed in the boot table,
documented in `config.md`, **read by nothing**. `JWC_SERVER_WORKERS`,
`JWC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`, `JWC_QUEUE_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `JWC_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and
nine more do not appear anywhere in `src/`. Implementing thirteen features
is not this change; their `doc` now begins `NOT IMPLEMENTED — `, the
generated table carries it, and the guard enforces the pairing in both
directions — a dead knob must be labelled, and a labelled knob must still
be dead.

### Also

`listening on http://0.0.0.0:8080` was the bind address printed verbatim.
A browser will not open it on Windows and it resolves to nothing useful
anywhere; the line exists to be clicked. It now reads
`listening on http://localhost:8080  (bound to 0.0.0.0 — every interface)`.

## [0.9.926] — the Intel Mac binary v0.9.925 did not ship — 2026-08-26

v0.9.925 put `x86_64-apple-darwin` on `macos-13`, the last Intel image.
That job sat **queued for 25 minutes** while all six other targets finished
in two and attached their archives. GitHub has been retiring the Intel
runners, and a release cannot be made to depend on a label that may or may
not have capacity.

So the tag shipped six archives and not the seventh, and `install.sh`'s
`darwin-x86_64` case pointed at an asset that was not there. An Intel Mac
running the one-liner got a 404.

Both macOS targets now build on `macos-14`. The arm64 one is native; the
x86_64 one is cross-compiled, which on macOS needs nothing beyond the
target's std — clang ships every architecture and the SDK is universal.

The `macOS compiles` CI job cross-checks `x86_64-apple-darwin` as well, for
the same reason it exists at all: a target only the release workflow builds
is a target whose first failure is a failed release. It caught nothing here
because the failure was a runner queue rather than the code — which is
exactly why the runner label moved instead.

`v0.9.925`'s other six archives are fine and that release is not being
rebuilt. An Intel Mac wants this tag.

### Also — `cargo fmt`

`cargo fmt --check` is CI's first step and I pushed 0.9.925 without running
it. The job failed there and never reached build or test, so the suite did
not run on main at all. Thirteen hunks, formatting only.

## [0.9.925] — static files, inside the binary — 2026-08-25

```jwc
static "/assets" from "public";
static "/" from "dist" cache 31536000;
```

JWC has never served a file. Not removed at the cutover, not deferred:
`apple-darwin`-style, it simply was not there — no `static`, no `ServeDir`,
nothing in the spec, nothing on the roadmap. A backend that cannot answer
`/favicon.ico` needs something else in front of it, which is a second
deployment for a language whose selling point is one binary.

### Binary bodies

`Response.body` was a `String`, so the wire could only carry UTF-8. A PNG
through `String::from_utf8_lossy` is a 200 with a corrupt image on it.

`Response` now carries `bytes: Option<Vec<u8>>` — a second field rather
than widening `body`, because every other response in the language is text
and every test that reads one is a string. Only a mount sets it, and
`into_axum` sends it when it is there.

### What a mount will not serve

Refusals, not repairs. Normalising `a/../b` to `b` means agreeing with the
operating system about every encoding, separator and case fold — get one
wrong and the path that was checked is not the path that is opened. So the
URL is split on `/`, each segment is percent-decoded **on its own**, and a
segment is refused outright when it is `..`, begins with `.`, decodes to
something holding `/`, `\`, `:` or NUL, or carries an escape that is not
`%` plus two hex digits. Splitting before decoding is why `a%2fb` is one
refused segment rather than two accepted ones.

What survives is joined and canonicalised, and the result must still be
under the canonical root — a symlink out of the tree is caught even when
every segment of the URL was an ordinary name.

`.env`, `.git/config`, `.htpasswd`, a directory listing: 404. A directory
answers its `index.html` or nothing.

### The tree goes into the binary

`jwc build` walks the mount, copies it into the crate it generates and
`include_bytes!`s it. `bin/release/app` is the deployment — verified by
copying the binary to an empty directory with no `public/` in sight and
watching it answer the PNG byte-for-byte.

The walk applies §10.3's rules too, so a `.env` sitting in a `dist/` is not
merely unreachable in the artifact — it is not in it.

### One implementation, two backends

The decisions — refusals, content type, `Cache-Control`, `If-None-Match` —
are `src/assets_core.rs.in`. `src/assets.rs` includes it; codegen pastes
the same file into the generated crate. The two backends do not implement
the section twice, they run the same text, and `tests/native.rs` asserts
the paste is verbatim.

Checked live: 25 probes — every file, every traversal spelling, 304, HEAD,
405, the binary, the declared-route and operational precedence — diffed
between `jwc serve` and the compiled binary. Status, body and every header
identical on all 25.

### Precedence, and what a mount cannot take

1. a declared `route` or `socket`
2. `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`
3. a `static` mount, in source order
4. 404

A mount at `"/"` therefore cannot capture the probes — a file named
`healthz` in a `dist/` does not answer `/readyz`, which is the same rule
that stopped jwc-shortener's `/{code}` from doing it.

### Headers, and the method

`Content-Type` by extension, with `application/octet-stream` for an unknown
one rather than a guess — a wrong `text/html` on a file someone uploaded is
a stored XSS. A strong `ETag` (sha256 of the bytes, so the native build can
compute it without an mtime it does not have), `Cache-Control`, and
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.

`POST` to a mounted path is **405** with `Allow: GET, HEAD`. A 404 there
sends the caller looking for a typo in a path that is right.

### `E0230` still stands

A route may not read a path the caller chose. A mount is not that: the root
is in the source, fixed at compile time, and the caller supplies only a
name inside it that the rules above have already refused unless it is an
ordinary file name. The hardening guard that pins `E0230` is untouched.

### Diagnostics

| | |
|---|---|
| `E0740` | the prefix is not a literal path beginning with `/` |
| `E0741` | the root is missing, or is not a directory |
| `E0742` | two mounts on one prefix |
| `E0743` | `cache` is not a number of seconds within the one-year ceiling |
| `E0744` | the root is outside the project — `jwc build` would embed it |

All five are reported when the program is **checked**, not at the first
request that misses.

### Also

`names.md`'s keyword table had drifted: `job`, `socket`, `dispatch`,
`buffered`, `retries`, `backoff`, `open`, `message` and `close` all had
grammatical meaning and none were listed. Regenerated against the parser,
sorted, with `static` and `cache` added.

## [0.9.924] — `$` is not required outside a query — 2026-08-25

`$` was mine, from v0.20.0, and nobody asked for it.

The reason it exists is real, and it is narrow. Inside a query clause a
bare identifier is a **column**, so a local has to be told apart from one:
without a mark, `where org_id == org_id` is a tautology that silently
deletes a tenancy boundary — the defect `gaps.md` records three times in
the sample, twice on a security path. The fix was a sigil on the local.

Then I extended it to **everywhere**, for uniformity, and that half was
not paid for by anything:

```jwc
function main() {
    for (attempt in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) {
        console.writeln("Attempt #" + string.of(attempt));   -- was $attempt
    }
}
```

There is no column named `attempt` in scope here. There is no ambiguity to
resolve. The sigil bought nothing and cost every line.

### The rule now

| where | `$` |
|---|---|
| query clause — `where`, `having`, `group by`, `orderby`, `join … on`, a projection field, an aggregate filter, an `insert` object literal, a `set` clause, `page after` | **required** |
| everywhere else — route bodies, services, `for`, `if`, argument lists, assignment | optional |

`attempt` and `$attempt` are the same reference outside a query, `x = 1;`
parses like `$x = 1;`, and `{ ...req }` spreads like `{ ...$req }` — a
column cannot be spread, so there is nothing to disambiguate. Nothing that
compiled before stops compiling; `jwc fmt` gives each spelling back the way
it was written rather than picking a side.

### A typo would have become a string

Making the bare form ordinary exposed something that was already wrong:
a bare name outside a query that matched no local and no declaration was
**silently accepted**, and the interpreter evaluated it to its own name as
text. `string.of(totl)` printed `totl`. It is `E0211: unknown name` now.

Two backends made that worse than a bad value: native codegen has no
binding to emit for such a name, so it refused to build a program the
interpreter had happily run. Rejecting it in the checker closes the
divergence at the source.

### Three rules were keyed on the sigil

Found by converting the templates and watching one stop compiling. Each of
these matched `ExprKind::Local` and would have gone quiet the moment
someone wrote the bare form:

- **null narrowing** — `if (found != null) { … found.x … }` reported
  `E0403` on a value it had just guarded;
- **`private` column egress** (`E0410`) — `json(account)` would have
  shipped a `private` column that `json($account)` refuses;
- **`request.path()` taint**, and the password-hash lint.

The first is a wrong error. The second is a **data leak**. Both are pinned
by corpus cases now, in both spellings.

### Guards

- `tests/native.rs` — the two spellings must emit **byte-identical** Rust.
  The interpreter reaches a local through one `lookup`; codegen reaches it
  through a scope stack it keeps itself, and that is the kind of second
  implementation that drifts.
- `tests/native.rs` — a bare name that is *not* a local is still refused by
  name, rather than emitted as a binding the generated crate lacks.
- `tests/type_corpus/cases/sigils.jwc` — both spellings compile outside a
  query; an unknown bare name is `E0211`; inside a query the column rule and
  `W0104` are unchanged.
- `tests/type_corpus/cases/private_columns.jwc` — the leak is caught in
  either spelling.

### Documentation

`names.md` §2.5/§5.3/§5.5 restate the rule and stop claiming the sigil is
universal. `syntax.md`, `control-flow.md`, `routing.md` and every guide
sample outside a query clause drop it, as do the three `jwc new`
templates — `jwc check` passes on all three. The conformance sample under
`docs/spec/v1/sample/` keeps the sigil throughout: it is the artifact that
proves the older spelling still compiles.

## [0.9.923] — macOS — 2026-08-25

There has never been a macOS build. Not deleted at a cutover, not dropped
from a matrix: `apple-darwin` has never appeared in `release.yml` in the
history of this repository. Meanwhile the install page claimed archives
for `x86_64-macos` and `aarch64-macos` until 0.9.915, and `install.sh` —
the honest one — stopped with "Unsupported platform: darwin-\*".

GitHub's macOS runners are free for public repositories, so the reason was
an oversight rather than a cost.

| | |
|---|---|
| `x86_64-apple-darwin` | `macos-13`, the last x86_64 image |
| `aarch64-apple-darwin` | `macos-14` |

Both build natively, so neither needs an SDK dance.

### The step that would have shipped nothing

The strip and package steps were `if: runner.os == 'Linux'`, and the zip
step `== 'Windows'`. Adding two darwin targets to the matrix without
touching those would have produced **two green build jobs and no
assets** — a release that looks complete and is missing a platform.

They are `!= 'Windows'` now, with `strip -x` on macOS (plain `strip` there
removes symbols the linker needs and the binary will not run) and
`shasum -a 256` where `sha256sum` does not exist.

### Checked before the tag, not by it

CI gets a `macos-14` job — `cargo check --workspace --all-targets
--features redis` — for the same reason the Windows one exists: a target
only the release workflow builds is a target whose first failure is a
failed release, which is how v0.9.913 shipped without a Windows binary.

The install-page guard used to carry a hardcoded "macOS is absent". That
made the guard the thing that was wrong the moment macOS was added, so it
now derives both directions from the matrix: every target built must be
named on the page, and every archive the page shows must be built.

## [0.9.922] — the rest of the registry — 2026-08-25

Closing the name-by-name diff of 0.9's builtin registry against 1.0's that
0.9.921 started. Everything on it is back except what is listed as still
gone at the bottom.

### The filesystem, and where it is allowed

| | |
|---|---|
| `file.read` | `text?` — `null` when it is not there |
| `file.write` / `file.append` / `file.delete` | `boolean` |
| `file.exists` / `file.size` | `boolean` / `bigint?` |
| `directory.exists` / `directory.create` | `boolean` |
| `directory.list` | `text[]`, **sorted** |

A missing file reads as `null` rather than raising — "is it there" is what
`file.exists` answers, and making `read` raise puts a `catch` around the
ordinary case.

**They are refused inside a route, middleware, `after`, `errorHandler`,
service, view, job or socket handler (`E0230`).** 0.9 placed no
restriction here at all, so this compiled:

```jwc
route GET "leak" {
    let secret = file.read(request.query("path") ?? "/etc/passwd");
}
```

A script needs files; an HTTP handler almost never does. The check is on
the body being compiled, not a call graph — a helper `function` reached
from both `main` and a route still passes, which is a smaller hole than
the one it closes and is stated in the spec rather than implied away.

Note that 0.9's *documentation* promised seventeen of these and its
runtime implemented seven. The ten that never existed are why every
documentation claim now has a test behind it.

### The last of the registry

`redis.eval` (what `rate_limit` is built on, and the only way to write a
different atomic sequence), `redis.exists`, `redis.ping` — all three were
already in `redis_engine` and in the native prelude, wired to nothing.

`unix_timestamp()`, `random_int(lo, hi)` — inclusive low, exclusive high,
and **not** a secret; `crypto.token` is. `sleep_ms(n)`, refused inside a
request for the same reason as the filesystem: a handler that sleeps holds
a connection open to do nothing.

`array.take`, `array.push`, `array.range`. `push` answers a **new** array:
a JWC value is not a reference, and a `push` that appeared to mutate one
would be the only place in the language where it did.

### Still gone, and why

`jwc upgrade`, `list`, `ok`, `v` from the CLI. `print`, whose buffering
made it a trap its own 0.9 documentation warned about. `ok()`, `html()`,
`text()` — `json`, `content(mime, body)` and `statusCode` cover them.
`setConnectionString`, `db_query`, `json_unchecked`, `set_json_field` —
`raw()` and `DATABASE_URL` are the 1.0 answers. Queue introspection
(`job_count`, `dlq_count`, `dlq_drain`) has no 1.0 shape yet: it wants a
vocabulary, not three built-ins.

## [0.9.921] — a language for HTTP backends could not make an HTTP request — 2026-08-25

A full diff of 0.9's builtin registry against 1.0's, prompted by `jwc run`
turning out to be missing: 113 names then, 110 now, and most of the
difference renames rather than losses. Checking each one by hand, the
largest real loss was the HTTP client — `http_get`, `http_post` and
`fetch_json`, deleted at the v0.25.0 cutover with nothing in their place.

A JWC service could not call a payment provider, exchange an OAuth code or
post a webhook. In a language whose subject is HTTP backends.

### `http.*`

| | |
|---|---|
| `http.get(url)` | the response body, as `text` |
| `http.post(url, body)` | same |
| `http.json(url)` | the body as `Raw` |
| `http.status(url)` | the status code |

A **non-2xx is not a raise**: a 404 from a remote service is an answer, and
making every caller wrap the call to discover that is worse than handing
them `http.status`. What raises is the request never happening — refused,
unresolvable, timed out — as `BadRequest`, so it is catchable.

`JWC_HTTP_ALLOWLIST` and `JWC_HTTP_BLOCK_PRIVATE` had survived in
`config::REGISTRY` the whole time, documenting builtins that no longer
existed. They mean what they say again, and both gates run before the
request is dispatched. Redirects are not followed at all: a redirect is how
an allowlisted host walks you to one that is not.

`src/native/prelude/http.rs.in` also survived — 166 lines of client and
SSRF guards, wired to nothing. The new surface reuses those guards rather
than carrying a second copy. What it does not reuse is 0.9's error
handling: `jwc_b_http_get` returned the failure *as the response body*, so
a URL the gate refused came back looking like a successful fetch of the
refusal text.

### `json.parse` / `json.stringify`

`Raw` on the way out of `parse`, the same as a `jsonb` column: it splices
into a response and is not read field-wise. Reading a field off it is
`E0310`, and a `class` is how to get typed values.

### Two defects found while testing this

**A bare `return;` in `main` reported an internal name.** `declared_port`
ran `main` through `run_block`, which does not unwrap the sentinel a
postfix `catch` throws to return from its enclosing function. A `return;`
inside a `catch` in `main` surfaced as
`main() raised __return_void at boot`.

**The native backend swallowed a raise in `main`.** `let _ =
jwc_user_main().await;` discarded the result, so a program whose `main`
raised printed nothing and started its listener anyway. It reports and
exits 1 now, as the interpreter does.

## [0.9.920] — `jwc run` comes back — 2026-08-25

```jwc
function main () {
    console.write("Hello, World!");
}
```

```
PS C:\Users\nbkab> jwc run .\app.jwc
error: unrecognized subcommand 'run'
```

That program was **valid 0.9**. Both halves of it — `jwc run` and
`console.write` — existed and worked, and the v0.25.0 cutover deleted them
with the rest of the 0.9 front-end. It was never on the restoration list
this series worked through, because that list was assembled from the
runtime and never from a diff of the CLI.

Both are back, and the program above now runs unchanged.

### `jwc run [path]`

Calls `main()` and exits. Nothing listens, and a program that declares no
`database` needs no `DATABASE_URL` — which is what makes a program that
only prints something you can actually run.

A `main` that calls `serve(...)` still starts a server: that is what the
call means, and `run` only declines to start one on the program's behalf.
A program with no `main` gets a message naming `jwc serve` instead.

### `console.*`

| | |
|---|---|
| `console.write(v)` | stdout, no trailing newline — for a prompt |
| `console.writeln(v)` | stdout, with one |
| `console.error(v)` | stderr |
| `console.read()` | one line from stdin, `null` at EOF |

Both write paths flush. 0.9 also had `print`, which appended to a buffer
flushed after `main` returned — so a prompt written before a read appeared
after the answer was due, and inside a route body whatever it printed
became the response body. Its own documentation called it a trap.
**`print` is not back**; this family is the reason it does not need to be.

Implemented on both backends and diffed: the same program under `jwc run`
and as a `jwc build` binary puts identical bytes on the terminal.

### What is still gone

`upgrade`, `list`, `ok` and `v` from the 0.9 CLI, and the `file.*` /
`directory.*` families. The filesystem surface is a security question of
its own — what a program may read, and whether a route body may read it at
all — and is not something to restore by reflex because it used to be
there.

## [0.9.919] — hello world needed a Postgres — 2026-08-25

Someone installed JWC on Windows, wrote the program everyone writes
first, and could not run it. Two of the reasons were defects.

### `serve` demanded a database from a program that has none

```
Error: DATABASE_URL (or JWC_DATABASE_URL) is required for db access
```

`cmd::serve` called `init_engine_from_env()` unconditionally. A program
that declares no `database` has no tables, no queries and nothing to
connect to — and the first program anyone writes is exactly that program,
so the first thing JWC said to them was that it needed a Postgres to print
a line. The connection and the live-schema check are both gated on a
`database` declaration now.

### `--port` skipped `main()`

`main` was reached only through `declared_port`, which runs it to find out
which port it asks for — and that lookup only happened when `--port` was
absent. So `jwc serve --port 3000` ran no `main` at all, and a `main` that
did anything besides call `serve` did it or not depending on a flag about
the port. It runs either way now; `--port` overrides what it declared.

### What is still missing, and is not a defect

`jwc run` **does not exist**. It did in 0.9.x, along with `print` and the
io builtins, and the v0.25.0 cutover deleted them with the rest of the
0.9 front-end. It was never on the restoration list this series worked
through, because that list was assembled from the runtime and never from a
diff of the CLI. Doing that diff now: 0.9 had 33 subcommands, 1.0 has 30,
and `run`, `upgrade`, `list`, `ok` and `v` are the difference.

So the smallest program that runs today is:

```jwc
namespace app;

function main() {
    debug.dump("Hello, World!");
}
```

```bash
jwc serve . --dev
```

which prints `[dump] "Hello, World!"` and then listens on 8080 serving
nothing. That is not a hello world; it is a server that happens to print.
Whether `jwc run` comes back is a language decision, not a bug fix.

## [0.9.918] — `import redis;` was optional — 2026-08-24

names.md §6.2.3 says a package import is what makes the package's
namespace resolvable: "`import redis;` is what makes
`redis.rate_limit(...)` resolvable". The checker resolved `redis.*`
whether the file imported it or not, so the implementation was looser
than its own specification.

That made the one line saying a program depends on a package optional,
and an optional line drifts out of the files that need it. `redis.*`
without `import redis;` is `E0202` now, with a note naming the import and
the `dependencies` entry it also needs.

`PACKAGE_NAMESPACES` in `check.rs` is the list this keys on: `redis` is
the only one. `cache`, `mail` and `socket` are the language's own and take
no import — the distinction was never written down anywhere, which is part
of why the two documentation pages describing it disagreed.

Nothing in the wild breaks: `jwc-shortener` already wrote `import redis;`
in the file that uses it. The convention was being followed; the compiler
just was not asking.

### builtins.md was still describing 0.9

- "`dispatch`, job queue, WebSocket, SSE | ROADMAP §7 — the new vocabulary
  cannot declare them yet" — all but SSE are declarations now
- §11 described `docs/docs/reference/builtins.md` as generated from the
  builtin table and checked by `tests/builtins_doc_sync.rs`. **Neither
  file exists.** A section about keeping documentation honest that was
  itself false
- two sections were numbered `## 10.`

## [0.9.917] — documentation that could not be checked — 2026-08-24

Two audits of `docs/docs/` against `src/`. What they found was not a list
of typos: three pages documented behaviour that has never existed.

### Documented, never implemented

| | |
|---|---|
| `packages/index.md` | "`jwc.lock` records the exact version and its checksum. It is committed" — there is no lockfile. No `jwc.lock` logic exists anywhere in `src/`, and `cli/index.md` said the opposite on the same site |
| `packages/index.md` | `{"path": "../redis"}` as a dependency, "No network, no publish step" — path dependencies are not implemented. The value was read as `"*"` and fetched from the registry |
| `packages/index.md`, `project-structure.md` | `tests/case_*.jwc` and `*_test.jwc` as test-file conventions — `jwc test` applies no filename filter at all. It runs every `test` block in the workspace, and `--filter` matches the block's name, not a path |

The path-dependency case was also a defect in the compiler, not only in
the page: `declared_dependencies` coerced any non-string requirement to
`"*"`, so a manifest written the way the docs described failed with a 404
about a version instead of a sentence about the manifest. It is refused
now, with a message naming what to do instead.

### Incomplete where it claimed to be complete

`config.md`'s environment table listed **7 of the 51** variables
`config.rs::REGISTRY` registers — every one that mail, the cache, jobs and
buffered writes need was missing, along with the whole CORS, JWT, queue
and retry families. The table is generated from the registry now and a
test regenerates and compares it; `JWC_UPDATE_DOCS=1` rewrites it.

The README's CLI table was missing 7 of 22 subcommands, `jwc new` and
`jwc build` among them. `routing.md` enumerated what a `routes` block
holds and left out `socket`. `intro.md` and `docs/docs/README.md` omitted
jobs and sockets from their maps; `removed.md` said the cutover's damage
was the native backend and listed nothing else that came back.

### The tests that make it stick

- every subcommand in `main.rs`'s `Command` enum appears in both CLI references
- the environment table matches `config.rs::REGISTRY` exactly
- the install page's platforms match `release.yml`'s build matrix, both ways
- the capability page names no declaration the parser accepts

Each of these was written because a page had already drifted. A page
nobody can check is a page that will be wrong.

## [0.9.916] — the page that argued against its own product — 2026-08-24

"What 1.0 does not have" listed background jobs, WebSocket, an in-process
cache and outbound email as not declarable, and had a table saying the
queue was **deleted**, that sockets were "unreachable — nothing can
declare one", and that "`cache.*` is not a built-in".

All four were implemented across 0.9.902–0.9.910. The page is the one
someone reads while deciding whether to adopt JWC, and it was telling them
the compiler could not do things it does.

It now says what is actually missing — SSE, sequences, generated columns,
a 0.9→1.0 codemod — carries a note saying the earlier version was wrong so
a reader who remembers it is corrected rather than confused, and lists the
four as present with links.

A test keys the page to the compiler: nothing in its absent section may
name a declaration keyword the parser accepts (`job`, `socket`, …) or a
namespace `is_namespace` resolves (`cache`, `mail`, `redis`). Restoring the
old `job` row to the page fails it.

### Uzbek in the English docs

Sample code threw `NotFound("akkaunt topilmadi")`, `Unauthorized("token
kerak")` and similar in twelve places across eight pages. Those are strings
this repository wrote, and they are English now.

The rest is not a docs bug and has not been changed: the compiler's own
validation messages really are Uzbek — `"password kamida 10 belgidan
iborat bo'lishi kerak"` is what a 400 body contains — so a page showing
anything else would be describing output that does not exist. What was
missing is that the docs never mentioned the per-rule `: "…"` override,
which is the only way to change them. `validation.md` now states the
default plainly and shows the override.

**There is still no global language setting for those messages.** That is a
product decision, not an oversight to fix quietly.

## [0.9.915] — the install page told you to run a 404 — 2026-08-24

The first page a new user opens was wrong in four ways at once, and every
one of them was introduced when the 1.0 docs replaced the 0.9 ones.

**It threw away the installers.** `install.sh` and `install.ps1` are in
this repository, resolve the latest release themselves, verify the
published `.sha256` and refuse to install on a mismatch. The 0.9 page led
with both one-liners. The 1.0 page mentioned neither.

**What it gave instead did not work.** A hand-rolled `curl` pinned to
`VERSION=0.9.9` — a tag that was never cut. The one command a new user
runs first answered 404.

**It promised macOS.** "Archives are published for `x86_64-linux`,
`aarch64-linux`, `x86_64-macos` and `aarch64-macos`." No macOS build has
ever existed; `install.sh` says so itself, stopping with "Unsupported
platform: darwin-\*". Someone on a Mac followed that sentence to a page of
assets that were not there.

**It left Windows out entirely** — which *is* built and published, as
`jwc-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-windows.zip`, with `install.ps1` to fetch it. So did
the README, whose only instruction was to build from source.

Both now lead with the one-liner for each platform, and the page's
platform table is checked against `release.yml`'s matrix by a test: a
target the release builds and the page does not name fails, and so does a
platform the page promises that nothing builds.

`docs/docs/deployment/index.md` pinned the same phantom `0.9.9`.

## [0.9.914] — the Windows build nobody compiled — 2026-08-24

`v0.9.913`'s release failed on `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, and only there.
The four Linux targets, every CI job and every local run were green.

```
error[E0425]: cannot find value `MAX_GENERATED_SUFFIX` in this scope
   --> src\native\mod.rs:473:18
error[E0425]: cannot find value `WINDOWS_MAX_PATH` in this scope
   --> src\native\mod.rs:473:41
```

Six of those, all inside `check_path_length`'s `#[cfg(windows)]` block —
the guard that turns a `LNK1104` at link time into a sentence about
`MAX_PATH`. Both constants were used and neither was ever declared.

Nothing compiled that block. CI runs on ubuntu, where the `cfg` strips it
out; the only job that built for Windows was the release workflow, which
runs on tags. So the earliest possible signal was a failed release, and
that is exactly when it arrived.

CI has a `windows-latest` job now — `cargo check --workspace --all-targets
--features redis`, no build and no tests, because its whole purpose is to
compile the branches ubuntu discards. On `windows-latest` rather than a
cross check from ubuntu because msvc is the target the release builds.

The fix was verified against a real Windows target rather than by reading
it: with mingw installed, `cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
--features redis` is clean, and deleting the two constants again
reproduces exactly the six `E0425`s the release reported. A cross check
for msvc is not available here — it dies in a C dependency's build script
looking for `lib.exe`.

Note for whoever reads this next: `ci.yml` triggers on `pull_request` and
on pushes to `main`, so a commit pushed to a branch with no open PR gets
**no CI at all**. This commit sat green-looking and unverified for that
reason; the local cross check above is what stands behind it.

## [0.9.913] — the test that tested itself — 2026-08-24

CI had been red for three commits on a lint the local toolchain could not
see. `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` floats, a new stable landed, and
`clippy::unnecessary_min_or_max` arrived with it:

```
error: `(MAX_BIND_PARAMS / (MAX_BIND_PARAMS + 10))` is never greater
       than `1` and has therefore no effect
```

Clippy was right about more than the arithmetic. The whole test restated
`flush`'s chunk-size formula rather than calling it, so it asserted that
its own copy matched itself — it would have passed with `flush` computing
something else entirely.

The formula is `rows_per_chunk(ncols)` now, called from both, and the test
checks the property over ten widths: a chunk never exceeds Postgres's
65 535-parameter ceiling and is never empty, including the table so wide
that one row alone exceeds it — which still sends that row, because one
failing statement beats a batch silently dropped.

## [0.9.912] — the docs half — 2026-08-24

`insert buffered` shipped in 0.9.910 with a spec clause and no user
documentation at all: `docs/docs/` did not contain the word. It has a
section now, under Writes, with what it costs you — no `as { … }`, no
`on conflict`, not inside `transaction { }`, and a full buffer drops the
row rather than queueing it.

`docs/docs/backend/sockets.md` still carried the `after`-block rule
0.9.911 corrected in the spec: "do not run, the response was the 101",
stated for the whole socket path rather than the handshake. Both halves
are in the table now.

## [0.9.911] — what `after { }` did not see — 2026-08-24

Three defects found by running the restored features together instead of
one at a time.

### An `after` block missed every rejected socket

`use RequireAuth` on a `socket` produces a `401` when the chain answers.
That is an ordinary HTTP response, but neither backend ran the `after`
chain for it, so an access log recorded rejected **routes** and not
rejected **upgrades** — the connections most worth looking at, missing,
with nothing to show they were.

routing §9.2 licensed it in one line: "`after` blocks do not run: an
`after` block observes a response, and the response was the 101." True of
the handshake, and the implementation applied it to the whole socket path.
The clause now states both halves — the upgrade is exempt, a chain that
answers is not — and both backends run every started middleware's `after`
block on the refusal, exactly as on a route (middleware §4.3).

The native half had a second layer: the socket refusal called
`jwc_to_response` and discarded its `extra_headers`, so the after blocks
ran and their headers were dropped on the floor.

### A program without `function main` could not be built

`main` is optional — `jwc serve` runs a program that has none — but the
generated `main` called `jwc_user_main()` unconditionally, so every such
program produced a crate that failed to compile. Every template and the
sample declare a `main`, which is why nothing hit it.

`tests/native.rs` does not invoke cargo, so no test compiles a generated
crate. It now checks the cheap half of what cargo would: every `jwc_*` the
generated module calls is defined in it. That will not catch a type error
or a missing `.await`, but "called and never defined" is the shape this
bug and the `ASYNC_BUILTINS` drift both took.

### The `insert buffered` codes were documented wrong

0.9.910's entry gave E0612/E0613/E0614 three meanings the checker does not
use. The codes are `as { … }` → `E0614`, `transaction { }` → `E0612`,
`on conflict` → `E0613`, as writes §7.2 has said throughout. The new
diagnostics guard checks that a code is documented; it cannot check that
it is documented *correctly*.

## [0.9.910] — buffered writes — 2026-08-24

The last of the features `src/queue.rs` and its neighbours took with them
at the cutover: a write that a request should not wait for.

```jwc
route POST "" {
    insert buffered into App.audit.Events values {
        actor: $user.id,
        action: "checkout",
        at: now(),
    };
    return ok();
}
```

`insert buffered` hands the row to a background writer and returns. The
writer holds rows briefly, then sends one multi-row `INSERT` per statement
shape — merging is the point, because one statement per row would move the
latency off the request and leave the database doing the same work.

### What it costs you

An unbuffered `insert` is part of your transaction and returns the row. A
buffered one is neither, and the checker holds you to that:

- it answers before the row exists, so `as { … }` is `E0614`;
- `on conflict` is `E0613` — a resolution nobody observes is a row
  silently not written;
- it is refused inside `transaction { }` (`E0612`), because the row is
  written later on another connection and a rollback would not take it
  back.

The buffer is bounded. When it is full the row is **dropped**, not queued
— which is the right trade for an audit trail and the wrong one for a
ledger. `jwc_log_dropped_total` says when that happens, and the six
`jwc_log_*` series on `/metrics` are byte-identical across `jwc serve` and
a native build.

### Diagnostics are audited now

Codes are assigned by hand and nothing checked them, so six were handed
out twice in one afternoon — `E0811` and `E0611` already meant something
else, and `E0011`–`E0014` are parser errors. A new guard reads every
`"E0xxx"` in `src/` against the specs' diagnostics tables and fails on a
code that is in two tables, in none, or in a table with nothing emitting
it.

Closing the gap it found: the 18 parser codes are now tabled individually
in names §7.1 instead of delegated wholesale to the grammar — six of them
state rules the EBNF does not carry, like a status code being bounded or
`right join` having been left out on purpose — and `E0376`, `E0511`,
`E0535`, `E0536` and `E0813` were added to the specs that own them.

## [0.9.909] — background jobs — 2026-08-24

`src/queue.rs` (1 352 lines) was deleted at the v0.25.0 cutover with no
equivalent, and `DEFERRED-16` said the vocabulary would have to be guessed.
It is written now.

```jwc
job SendWelcome(account_id: bigint, email: text) retries 5 backoff "30s" {
    let account = select A from App.auth.Accounts
        where id == $account_id
        first or throw NotFound("akkaunt topilmadi");

    mail.send($email, "Welcome", "<p>salom</p>");
}
```

```jwc
dispatch SendWelcome(account_id: $account.id, email: $account.email);
```

### A declaration, not two strings

0.9's form was `dispatch(name, payload_json)`. A handler that expected
`account_id` and a caller that sent `accountId` typechecked, ran, and
failed at 3am with a JSON parse error in a worker log. Here the dispatch
site is checked against the declaration like any other call: a misspelled
name is `E0368`, a missing one `E0369`, the wrong type `E0367`.

A payload is a row that outlives the process, so a parameter is a scalar
or an array of scalars (`E0362`) — pass the id, and read the row in the
handler, where it is current.

### It is part of your transaction

The row is written on the request's connection, before the response goes
out, so a `transaction { }` around a dispatch rolls it back with
everything else. "Send the email **only if** the account was created" is a
sentence you can write here; against an external broker it is not.

### Durable only

0.9 shipped two drivers and defaulted to the wrong one:
`JWC_QUEUE_DRIVER=memory` was the default, and every pending job died with
the process. That is not a queue — the enqueue succeeded and the work
never happened, with nothing anywhere to see. There is one driver, and it
is the database the program already has.

`public._jwc_jobs` and `public._jwc_jobs_dead` are created at boot like
`_jwc_migrations`, and are deliberately not part of the declared schema:
`jwc migrate new` would want to diff them and a snapshot would carry rows
of pending work as if they were schema.

Delivery is at-least-once — `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, a lease a
dead worker loses — which is the strongest guarantee a queue on a database
can honestly make, and jobs.md §3.3 says so where a reader will find it.

An attempt that raises is retried after `backoff`; the one that exhausts
`retries` moves to the dead-letter table with its payload and its last
error, so it can be fixed and replayed. A queued row whose declaration is
gone — a deploy that dropped a `job` — is dead-lettered rather than
retried forever.

`/metrics` reports `jwc_jobs_pending`, `jwc_jobs_dead`,
`jwc_jobs_processed_total`, `jwc_jobs_failed_total`,
`jwc_jobs_dead_total`. A program with no `job` starts no workers and
creates no tables.

Both backends, verified against a real Postgres: three jobs processed,
three attempts on a failing one, one dead letter, same message.

### `jwc new --template jobs`

The template that could not exist without this.

### Two defects found on the way

**Any program that queried a database and never paged failed to build
natively.** The db prelude carries the cursor codec whole,
`jwc_cursor_encode` calls `jwc_hmac_sha256_hex`, and that lives in the
crypto prelude — which was linked only when the program paged. The
generated crate referenced an undefined function and an unlinked
`base64`.

**A program with no sockets stopped compiling** once the base prelude's
request handler took an `Option<WebSocketUpgrade>`: the prelude is one
text blob, not a template, so gating axum's `ws` feature and not the
signature broke every other program. The feature is unconditional now.

## [0.9.908] — sockets — 2026-08-24

`src/native/prelude/ws.rs.in` came back with the native backend and could
not be reached: `PRELUDE_WS` was declared, concatenated into no generated
crate, and the dispatcher answered 501. Nothing in the 1.0 grammar
declared a socket, so nothing could.

```jwc
routes "/live" use RequireAuth {
    socket "rooms/{room: text}" {
        on open    { socket.send("joined " + @room); }
        on message (text) { socket.send("echo: " + $text); }
        on close   { }
    }
}
```

### Why three handlers instead of `route WS`

The 0.9 form was `route WS "…" { … }` with one body that ran per
connection and called `ws_recv()` in a loop. 1.0 has no unbounded loop —
`for` over a collection is the only iteration — and adding `while` to
serve sockets would have been a worse trade than saying what a socket
handler actually is: three moments in a connection's life.

The runtime owns the loop, which also removes the failure mode a
hand-written one has, where forgetting to break holds a task for the life
of the process.

### Middleware runs before the upgrade

This is the whole value of `use` on a socket. A client with no token gets
**401 with the middleware's message**, as an ordinary HTTP response — not
a 101 followed by an immediate close it has to guess about. Verified
identical on both backends:

```
--- no key:    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized   {"error":"kalit kerak"}
--- with key:  HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
               "salom, abc" / "echo: hello" / close
```

Whatever the chain puts in `context` persists for the connection; locals
do not, because each handler runs on its own scope.

### Both backends, one implementation each

`serve.rs` uses axum's WebSocket support. So does the native prelude now:
its 291 lines of hand-rolled RFC 6455 — SHA-1, base64, frame masking —
predated the native server moving to axum and were running nowhere. Two
hand-written WebSocket stacks is one more than the number that can be kept
correct.

`socket.send` and `socket.close` **queue** on both, and the connection
writes what a handler produced once it returns. That is what makes
`socket.close()` followed by `socket.send(...)` drop the send on both
rather than on one, and it means a handler that panics cannot leave a
half-written frame on the wire.

### Along the way

- A plain `GET` at a socket path answered **500** on the interpreter: the
  route matched, no HTTP body existed for it, and the chain's
  fall-through said "internal_error" about a client mistake. It is a 400
  now on both — the path exists, the request is wrong.
- `jwc routes` prints sockets as `WS`. `jwc openapi` lists them under
  `x-jwc-sockets` rather than emitting the upgrade as a `GET` that answers
  200, which is a lie a client generator acts on.
- `route GET "/x"` and `socket "/x"` in one block is `E0710`: the upgrade
  *is* a GET.

### Not implemented: Server-Sent Events

`DEFERRED-19`. 0.9 parsed and validated `route SSE "…"` end to end and
dispatched it to a stub, so a program could declare one, pass every check
and serve nothing. That is worse than not having it.

## [0.9.907] — the rest of the package CLI — 2026-08-24

Of the package commands, only `jwc add` survived the cutover. The four
that did not are back, over the vendoring model 1.0 actually uses — a
range in `jwcproj.json`, sources under `jwc_packages/`, no lockfile and no
resolver.

| | |
|---|---|
| `jwc install [--force]` | fetch every declared dependency that is missing |
| `jwc update [-p name]` | move within the recorded ranges |
| `jwc remove <name>` | drop it from the manifest and from disk |
| `jwc tree` | declared, vendored, and at which version |

`jwc install` is what a fresh clone needs: the templates gitignore
`jwc_packages/`, so a checkout has the manifest and none of the sources
and every package `import` fails on a line that looks correct. It fetches
only what is missing, so it is safe in a build script, and it follows a
package's own dependencies without looping when they are cyclic.

`jwc update` respects the range the manifest records — `^0.2.1` reaches
the newest `0.2.x` and never `0.3.0`. Crossing a major stays
`jwc add name@version`, which is a change to the requirement and shows up
in the diff as one. An unparseable range is an error rather than a silent
"take the newest": a typo in a version must not quietly become whatever
shipped today.

`jwc remove` and `jwc tree` never open a socket.

### `jwc update <path>` looked for a dependency called `./svc`

`name: Option<String>` before `path: PathBuf` (defaulted) is ambiguous to
a parser, and clap resolved it by reading the first positional as the
name. So `jwc update ./svc` set `name = "./svc"`, `path = "."`, and
answered "no dependencies declared" from whatever directory you happened
to be in. The selector is `--package` / `-p` now, and `path` is the
positional every other command in this CLI takes first.

### Not restored: `jwc upgrade`

Its rule registry was empty. The command printed "no rules registered at
this JWC version" and returned. There is nothing in it to bring back — a
0.9→1.0 codemod would be new work, and a large piece of it.

## [0.9.906] — `jwc swagger`, and the 201 that was documented as a 200 — 2026-08-24

### The old `jwc swagger` was not what I said it was

I listed it as a pure loss. It was not, quite. `src/swagger.rs` (661
lines) was a **second OpenAPI generator** and the command wrote its output
to `openapi.json` — which is `jwc openapi --out openapi.json` today.
Restoring it verbatim would have put two generators in the tree to keep in
step by hand, which is the mistake the native backend avoids by calling
`query_sql` instead of reimplementing it.

What never existed, in either version, is somewhere to *read* the API.
That is what `jwc swagger` is now:

```bash
jwc swagger .                  # http://127.0.0.1:8099
jwc swagger . --out api.html   # the page as one file
```

Same document, same generator. The page is self-contained — no CDN, no
vendored `swagger-ui-dist` — so it opens on an air-gapped box, pins no
third-party script into a developer's browser, and adds no megabyte of
JavaScript to the binary. It listens on loopback: an unauthenticated
description of every endpoint does not belong on a network interface.

### Every `created(json(x))` was documented wrong

Reading the rendered page is what showed it. `POST /notes` claimed two
responses:

- `200`, carrying the created object — a status the route cannot answer
- `201`, carrying nothing — the status it does answer, with the body gone

The inner `json($row)` recorded a 200 with the row's type, then the outer
`created(...)` recorded a 201 with the type of *a response*, which has no
schema. `created(json(x))` is the idiomatic form — the specification's
sample uses it, every template uses it — so effectively every POST in
every generated document was wrong, and a client generator reading one
produced the wrong type for every created resource.

The outer status now takes the inner recording's payload and drops the
inner entry. The test asserts it over the sample: no POST documents both
200 and 201, and every 201 carries a body.

## [0.9.905] — `jwc new` comes back, and brings three defects with it — 2026-08-24

### `jwc new` was gone; the templates were not

`src/templates.rs` went at the v0.25.0 cutover and the command with it,
but `templates/{api,auth,jobs}/` stayed on disk — unreferenced, and
written in a grammar the compiler had stopped accepting. Nothing noticed,
because no test ever fed them to the compiler.

Three trees now exist in the 1.0 vocabulary:

| `--template` | What you get |
|---|---|
| `empty` (default) | one route, one schema, no tables |
| `api` | CRUD over one table: DTOs, a service, five routes, keyset paging |
| `auth` | accounts, Argon2id passwords, JWT sessions, `RequireAuth` |

`tests/templates.rs` scaffolds each one and puts `check --deny-warnings`,
`lint --deny-warnings`, `fmt --check`, `routes`, `openapi` and `migrate
new` over it. A template that starts a project with a warning is a failing
build. `jobs` is not back: it needs a queue, and the 1.0 grammar has no
way to declare one.

Writing the templates found three things.

### `jwc fmt` deleted doc comments

`---` above a table-level `check`, `unique`, `primary key` or `foreign
key` was **dropped**. The parser computed the attached comment for every
table member and handed it only to columns and indexes; the four
constraint parsers discarded it. It survived on `index`, which is why it
went unnoticed. A formatter that loses documentation is worse than no
formatter, and `fmt --check` in CI is exactly what pushes people to run
it.

### `W1302` recommended syntax that did not parse

> `ck_accounts__email__pattern` carries no message, so violating it is a
> 500
> — help: add `: "…"` to make it a declared error

Only `unique` and the table-level forms took a message. On a column rule
— `minLength(2)`, `pattern(r"…")`, `min(0)` — the advice was
unimplementable. The specification's own sample tripped the warning
eleven times and could not act on it.

Rules take a message now, on columns and on class fields alike:

```jwc
email varchar(255) unique : "bu email band", pattern(r"^[^@]+@[^@]+$") : "email yaroqsiz";
```

On a class field it replaces the generated sentence in the
`validation_failed` body, so the request boundary and the table can say
the same thing. The sample lints clean for the first time.

### Two lint tests depended on the sample being sloppy

They asserted the sample *had* a message-less constraint, so fixing the
sample broke them. The untidy shapes moved to `tests/lint_constraints/`,
where they are labelled as deliberate, and the sample gained a test that
it stays clean.

## [0.9.904] — the built-ins that were declared but not built — 2026-08-24

Three things the language advertised and did not do.

### `mail.send` delivered nothing, and said nothing

`check.rs` typed it — arity 3, `void` — and the interpreter's built-in
table mapped it to one line:

```rust
"mail.send" => Value::Null,
```

A password-reset route typechecked, ran, returned 200 and sent no mail.
The six `JWC_SMTP_*` variables were already in the config registry and
`lettre` was already a dependency; only the code between them was
missing. It is back, as `src/mail.rs` on both backends, and it **raises**
when no relay is configured — the rule `redis.*` already follows, for the
reason a silent stub taught: "no server" must never read as "sent".
`mail.enabled()` is what to branch on when the send is optional.

### `cache.*` was in the runtime and out of the language

The native prelude has carried `jwc_cache_store` since the backend came
back, but `cache` was not a namespace, so no 1.0 program could name it.
It is a namespace now — `cache.get`, `cache.set`, `cache.del`,
`cache.clear` — with the same four shapes as their `redis.*`
counterparts, so moving a call between them is a rename.

The store this restores was unbounded: it evicted only on a `get` of the
expired key itself, so a program caching per-request keys it never read
back grew it until the process died. Entries are now capped by
`JWC_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES` (default 10 000) — at the cap a write sweeps what
has expired, then evicts the oldest — and `/metrics` reports
`jwc_cache_entries`, `_hits_total`, `_misses_total`, `_evicted_total`,
because a cache that has quietly become a no-op looks exactly like one
that works.

### Every database-free native build failed to compile

`jwc build` advertises the database-free tier as its coverage. Nothing in
that tier compiled: the no-DB `/metrics` emitter was a `push_str` of a
literal whose format holes had been escaped as if it were a `format!`, so
the generated crate carried `"{{}}…{{}}"` and rustc refused it with
"multiple unused formatting arguments". Programs *with* a database took
the other branch and were fine, which is why the differential runs never
saw it.

Two guards now stand where the class of bug lives: `ASYNC_BUILTINS` and
the new `RESULT_BUILTINS` are checked against the prelude sources at test
time, in both directions. The first run found a real gap
(`jwc_b_redis_rate_limit`). Getting either list wrong breaks only the
*generated* crate, which no test in this repo compiles.

## [0.9.903] — three defects a real port found — 2026-08-21

Porting task-tracker — a 0.9.x board API with 36 source files, m2m
labels and assignees, an audit feed and three grouped aggregates — to
1.0 turned up three defects in the compiler. Each is fixed with the
corpus case that would have caught it.

### A grouped column could not be aliased

```jwc
group by T.column_id, C.name
as { column_id: T.column_id, column_name: C.name, total: count(T.id) }
```

`E0531: column_name is neither aggregated nor grouped` — against a
column that is plainly in the `group by`. `group by` collects the column
name from either spelling, bare or qualified, but the alias map that
maps a projection alias back to its column read only the bare one. So
`as { name: C.name }` passed by coincidence (the alias equals the column
name) and `as { column_name: C.name }` did not.

### A record could not be written to a `jsonb` column

types.md §5.6 says a `jsonb` value written from code takes any `Record`,
array, scalar or `Raw` — it is the one column type whose shape is not
the schema's business. The lattice did not have that rule, so an audit
payload could only be written as a pre-encoded string.

### The native backend refused `=?` and `page`

Both are lowered now.

**`=?`** — which columns an `update` sets is a run-time fact, so every
combination is compiled and a mask picks one. Two optional assignments
is four statements; the cap is eight (256), which is far past anything a
PATCH endpoint writes. The all-absent combination sets nothing and falls
back to selecting the row as it stands, exactly as `exec::run_update`
does. Each value is evaluated once, before the branch: an `=?` whose
value calls `date.now()` must not be called to test for presence and
again to bind.

**`page`** — the cursor codec, the envelope and the HMAC are transcribed
from `cursor.rs` and `exec::page_envelope`. `server { cursor_secret }`
is emitted as the *expression*, not the value `jwc build` happened to
read: it is almost always `env("CURSOR_SECRET")`, and baking that in
would sign every deployment's cursors with the builder's secret.

### `...` spread in an `update`, and `with { … }`

Both were refused; both are lowered now, and with them all three
applications in the ecosystem — jwc-shortener, MyWallet and task-tracker
— build natively and answer `jwc serve` byte for byte.

**The spread.** Which columns `set ...$req` writes is the fields the
value actually carries. *Which fields it could carry* is the source's
declared type, and the AST says that outright in the two places a spread
source comes from: a typed function parameter, and
`let x = request.body() as C`. No type inference — codegen reads the
declaration and enumerates from there, the same mask the `=?` case uses.

The presence test is different, though, and it matters: `=?` skips when
the value is null, a spread skips when the key is **absent**. types.md
§6.5 keeps the two apart and §9.2 relies on it — a body that sends
`"note": null` clears the column, one that omits `note` leaves it. So
the prelude grew `jwc_has_field`, which `jwc_get_field` cannot answer
because it returns null for both.

**`with { … }`** replaces a header of the same name rather than appending
(routing.md §6.2). A builder has already stamped `content-type`, and two
of them is a malformed message (RFC 9110 §8.3) that clients resolve
inconsistently. `content_type` is its own field on the response object
and `jwc_to_response` reads it before the header map, so a
`with { "Content-Type": … }` that only landed in the map would lose to
the builder's — it is copied across.

### Also in the native backend

- `jwt.sign(claims, secret, ttl_minutes)` — the prelude had the 0.9
  two-argument form, which silently dropped the TTL.
- `context.<key>` and `@param` were emitted as bare `&str` where the
  built-in wanted a `V`.

## [0.9.902] — the native build answers what `jwc serve` answers — 2026-08-21

0.9.901 brought the native AOT backend back but covered only the
database-free tier: routes, control flow, expressions, and the built-ins
the restored prelude implements. Everything else was refused by name.
This closes the rest of it, and the acceptance test is not "it compiles"
— it is that the generated binary and `jwc serve` return **byte-identical**
responses, header for header, over a program that exercises every piece.

### What the pass now lowers

| | 0.9.901 | 0.9.902 |
|---|---|---|
| `select` | ✅ | ✅ |
| `insert` / `update` / `delete` | ❌ | ✅ |
| `transaction { }` | ❌ | ✅ |
| `middleware`, `requires`, `provides`, `after { }` | ❌ | ✅ |
| `service` | ❌ | ✅ |
| `throw`, `or throw`, postfix `catch` | ❌ | ✅ |
| `request.body() as <Class>` | ❌ | ✅ |
| typed path parameters | ❌ | ✅ |
| `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics` | ❌ | ✅ |
| `view` | ❌ | ❌ |
| `page after $c size $n` | ❌ | ❌ |
| `...` spread in a write, `=?` | ❌ | ❌ |

The last three are still refused by name, and the message says which
construct and that `jwc serve` runs it. A binary that quietly dropped a
query would be a far worse outcome than one that will not build.

### Errors are a `Result`, not a panic

A JWC `throw` now travels the way Rust travels errors: a generated
function returns `Result<V, JwcThrown>` and every call site propagates
with `?`. The alternative — unwinding across `.await` and catching at the
route boundary — needs `UnwindSafe` futures and poisons whatever lock or
pooled connection was held at the point of the throw.

Panics stay what they were: `Abort::Fault`, the 500. They are now caught
at the route boundary, so a fault answers 500 instead of dropping the
connection — the one failure a client cannot tell apart from the server
being gone.

### Where the two backends had drifted

Restoring the 0.9 prelude verbatim was the right call for 5,030 lines of
working runtime, but it carried 0.9's answers to questions 1.0 answers
differently. Each of these was a wire-visible difference between `jwc
serve` and the binary built from the same source:

- Every JSON response was `application/json`; the interpreter emits
  `application/json; charset=utf-8`. **Every** response differed.
- An unmatched path returned a four-key envelope, and a known path under
  the wrong verb returned 405 with `Allow`. 1.0 returns
  `{"error":"not found"}` and 404 for both.
- `notFound("gone")` served the four bytes `gone` as `text/plain`;
  the interpreter serves `{"error":"gone"}`.
- `created(json($row))` wrapped the response object as a body instead of
  re-statusing it, so the body was the marker object and the status 200.
- `noContent()` announced `text/plain; charset=utf-8` on a 204.
- `/metrics` reported two gauges under different `HELP` text and omitted
  `jwc_db_pool_max_size`, `jwc_db_pool_waiting` and `jwc_routes`.
- `internalError()` took an argument and echoed it.

All of them now come from one place per question, and the differential
run is what says so.

### The parts that had no native half at all

- **Typed path parameters.** `{id: bigint}` was matched as text and the
  type discarded, so `/notes/abc` reached the query layer and became a
  500. routing.md §3.2 makes it a 400 *before* middleware, with a body
  naming the parameter and the type — which is what it is now.
- **`request.route()`** returned the request path, so a rate-limit key
  bucketed by every distinct id instead of by route.
- **Class validation.** `validate.rs` is now mirrored in the prelude and
  driven by a table emitted from the same `ClassSym`s the checker built.
  A rule the checker accepted is a rule the binary enforces; a second,
  hand-written description of a class is what let `pattern(r"^https?://")`
  accept `javascript:` in an earlier backend.
- **Constraint violations.** A unique violation panicked into a 500.
  errors.md §6 makes a constraint carrying a message a declared error —
  `Conflict` for 23505, `BadRequest` for a check or not-null — and one
  without a message stays a fault.

### One bug worth naming

Every INSERT bound `null` for every column. The builder marks each INSERT
parameter `Bind::Expr` over a placeholder expression and
`exec::run_insert` supplies the values positionally, bypassing
`bind_params` entirely; deriving them from the placeholder — which is
`ExprKind::Null` — bound null for each. Postgres reported it as a
not-null violation on a column the program had plainly set.

### What running the real application found

The differential above uses a program written to exercise the tier. Then
jwc-shortener — 10 routes, three HTML pages, an SVG, Swagger, Redis rate
limiting — was built and diffed the same way, and found three more:

- **`crypto.token`, `string.of`, `string.slice`, `string.strip_prefix`,
  `date.hours`.** The restored prelude predates the 1.0 vocabulary, so it
  had no counterpart for the built-ins 1.0 introduced. `jwc build` refused
  on the first one and named it, which is the right failure — but it is
  still a refusal. All of `builtins.md` §2–§8 is now implemented, except
  `date.add`, which `exec_call.rs` has no arm for either: `jwc serve` does
  not run that one, and the message says so.
- **`redis.*`.** 1.0 spells the Redis surface as a built-in namespace with
  `get`/`set`/`del`/`incr`/`expire`/`rate_limit`/`enabled`. The prelude had
  the 0.9 `redis_*` names, no `rate_limit`, and answered rather than
  faulting when no server was configured — which would let a rate limiter
  allow everything.
- **The router took the first match, not the most specific.** The
  interpreter scores candidates by literal-segment count. jwc-shortener
  declares `/{code}` for its redirects beside `/docs`, `/openapi.json`,
  `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml` and `/og.svg`; the native binary gave all
  five to the redirect handler and answered 404.
- **`env(name)` answered `""` for an unset variable, not null.** `??` only
  fires on null, so `env("PUBLIC_BASE_URL") ?? "https://1kb.uz"` produced
  the empty string and the short links came out as `/abc1234` with no host.

### Which prelude a program gets

Read off the prelude sources rather than a hand-kept list: codegen records
every prelude function the program reached and asks each prelude file
whether it defines it. A crate with no `pattern` rule anywhere does not
compile the regex engine; one with no query does not compile
tokio-postgres.

## [0.9.901] — `as "…"` was unusable — 2026-08-21

Two defects, both found porting MyWallet — a JWC backend written against
0.9.x — to the 1.0 vocabulary. Both are on `as "physical_name"`, which
exists so a program can keep the names a database already has, and which
is therefore the first thing a port off an older version reaches for.
MyWallet's four tables are `user`, `wallet`, `category` and `transaction`.

### A foreign key could not name a renamed table

The target's physical name was derived from the **reference** —
`references App.public.Users` → `users` — instead of from the target,
which had renamed itself to `user`. So the key did not resolve, and the
diagnostic named a table the source never wrote:

```
error[E0422]: `public.users` is not a declared table
   = help: every foreign key target must be declared in this program
```

against a program that declares exactly that table. Resolution now happens
after every table is known, keyed on the declared name.

jwc-shortener did not show this: it uses `as "…"` on both its tables and
neither is a foreign-key target.

### `RETURNING` did not quote a reserved physical name

`RETURNING` exposes the target under its own name, and the projection was
built against it unquoted:

```sql
INSERT INTO public."user" (…) RETURNING json_build_object('id', user.id)::text
                                                          ^^^^ the USER function
ERROR:  syntax error at or near "."
```

`user` there is the SQL `USER` function and the parser stops at the dot.
Every read path already went through `quote_ident`; only this one did not,
so the failure needed a write, a `RETURNING` projection and a reserved
physical name all at once — which is an ordinary combination in a ported
schema, and which made `POST /auth/register` a 500 that type-checked
clean.

Both are covered by `tests/reserved_names`, which drives insert, update
and delete against a real Postgres through a table named `user` that
another table points at.

## [0.9.901] — the native backend comes back — 2026-08-21

### What was deleted, and by whom

The v0.25.0 cutover (`60cc971`) removed 73 source files, and among them the
whole native AOT backend: 5,149 lines of codegen and 5,030 of prelude, plus
the background queue, the in-process cache, WebSocket/SSE and the mail
sender. The ROADMAP section that authorised it was written the day before
in the same hand. Neither the plan nor the deletion was put to the
maintainer, and neither was the maintainer's to discover afterwards.

The stated reason was that a second implementation of the query compiler
would have to move in lockstep with the first. **That reason does not
survive the 1.0 front-end.** `query_sql` already lowers a query to a SQL
string and a parameter list at compile time, so codegen embeds the very
string the interpreter sends: there is no second query compiler, and no
query semantics that can drift.

The roadmap also promised `jwc build --native` would answer `E0910` naming
the reason and the release it returns in. It did not: `build` was not a
subcommand at all, so the answer was clap's `unrecognized subcommand`.

### `jwc build` is back

* **The prelude returns unchanged** — 5,030 lines across base, db, crypto,
  redis, ws and http. It references no AST type, so it needed no port.
* **The codegen is new**, written against the 1.0 AST. The old one named
  `RouteDecl` with a bare path, `MountDecl`, `ModelKind` and `validate
  body`; none of those exist now.
* `jwc build --emit-rust` writes the generated source and stops, so what
  cargo is about to compile can be read first.

Verified end to end: a program with routes, a free function, `??`, a `for`
loop with `continue`, and `string.upper` generates Rust, compiles to a
42 MB binary, serves HTTP, and answers **byte-for-byte what `jwc serve`
answers** on every route.

### `serve(port)` means the same thing on both backends

The first cut of the generated `main` read `PORT` from the environment.
The interpreter evaluates `main` and takes the argument of `serve(…)`
(config.md §3.2.2), so a program that hardcodes its port would have been
served on two different ports depending on the backend. The generated
`main` now runs the program's own `main`, and `serve(n)` records the port.

### Coverage, stated rather than implied

This pass lowers the database-free tier: routes, control flow,
expressions, and the built-ins the prelude implements. Tables, views,
services, middleware, queries, `transaction`, `with { }`, postfix `catch`
and `request.body() as C` are **refused by name**, with the construct
printed and a pointer to `jwc serve`, which runs the whole language. A
native binary that silently dropped a query would be a far worse outcome
than one that will not build.

The 1.0 built-ins the prelude predates — `string.of`, `array.sum`,
`date.*`, `crypto.token`, `content`, `redirect` and the rest — are listed
in `PRELUDE_GAPS` and refused individually by name. That list is a
worklist, not a shrug.

### Still to come back

`queue.rs` (1,352 lines), `cache.rs` (177), `email.rs` (180),
`log_writer.rs` (466), `swagger.rs` (661), `templates.rs` (416) and the
package resolver, lockfile and registry client (~830). All of it is in git
at `60cc971^` and none of it is lost.

## [0.9.9] — porting a real app to 1.0 — 2026-08-21

Seven defects, all found by porting jwc-shortener — a service that has been
in production since long before the cutover — from the 0.9.x vocabulary to
1.0. Each one stopped the port dead, and each is now pinned by a test that
fails without its fix.

### The language could not answer anything but JSON

`routing.md` §6.1 said so outright: "There is no bare-string response
body." That rules out a landing page, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` and an
OpenGraph card — five of jwc-shortener's routes. The documented workaround,
`statusCode(200, $html) with { "Content-Type": "text/html" }`, produced a
response with **two** `content-type` headers — the builder's
`application/json` and the author's — around a body that was still
JSON-encoded, so a browser was handed `"<h1>…</h1>"`, quotes included.

- **`content(mime, body)`** (routing.md §6.5) sends `body` verbatim under
  `mime`. The media type is a string literal, so framing can never depend
  on a runtime value and `jwc openapi` can name it; `text/*` gains
  `charset=utf-8`. It composes with the other builders, because a response
  is a value: `statusCode(404, content("text/html", $page))`.
- **`with { }` now replaces** a header the builder already set, matched
  case-insensitively, instead of appending a second one. Two `Content-Type`
  headers is a malformed message (RFC 9110 §8.3) that clients resolve
  differently.
- New: `E0735` (media type is not a literal), `E0736` (body is not `text`).

### `serve(port)` was never evaluated

`main()` was parsed, checked for arity, and then dropped. The listener took
the CLI default, so a program asking for 3000 silently got 8080 — and
`serve(int(env("PORT") ?? "8080"))`, the form this spec's own sample uses,
could not work at all. `main` now runs at boot on an ordinary Vm, which is
what makes the argument an expression rather than a decoration.
`jwc serve --port N` overrides it (config.md §3.2.2).

### `break` and `continue` did not exist

`errors.md` §7.2 is normative that a postfix `catch` block must "`return`,
`throw`, `break` or `continue`", and `E1020`'s help text says the same — so
a reader who did what the diagnostic told them got the diagnostic again.
Neither statement was in the grammar, the AST, or the parser. Both are
implemented now, which is what makes a retry-on-conflict loop expressible:
the handler has to stay inside the loop, and `return`/`throw` leave the
function. `E0813` outside a `for` body.

### Whole-table aggregates were rejected

`queries.md` §6.2 allows an aggregate projection in "a query that has a
`group by`, **or that has exactly one binding and no non-aggregate
projection fields**". Only the first half was implemented, so
`as { total: count(A.id) }` — asking a table how many rows it has — was
`E0530`. Such a query answers exactly one row for any table, empty
included, so it also needs no `orderby` under `first` and its type is `T`,
not `T?`: requiring an `or throw` on a branch that cannot be taken is how a
real null check learns to be ignored.

### `timestamptz - interval` faulted

types.md §12.2 specifies `timestamptz - timestamptz → interval` and
`timestamptz - interval → timestamptz`. `+` carried its timestamptz
overload from the start; `-` fell through to the numeric path and faulted
with "arithmetic is not defined here". The checker allowed both, so
`date.now() - date.hours(24)` compiled and answered 500 — and that is how a
query asks for "the last day".

### A long `+` chain was nesting

1.0 has no multi-line string literal (names.md §2.3, §2.4), so a page is
built from its own lines. Evaluating that chain by recursion spent one
`MAX_DEPTH` level per term, and jwc-shortener's landing page is 360 of
them: it compiled, served, and answered 500 with "expression nesting is too
deep". A left-leaning chain is a loop wearing a tree's shape, and is now
folded as one.

### A wildcard route swallowed the operational endpoints

config.md §4.0.3 — "a declared route wins" — was implemented as "anything
that matched wins", and the two differ when the match came from a path
parameter. jwc-shortener declares `/{code}` for its redirects; it spans one
segment, so it spanned `/readyz` and `/metrics` too, and the readiness probe
answered `404 {"error":"bunday havola yo'q"}`. Every pod would have stayed
out of rotation, and nothing in the source names `/readyz` for an operator
to go looking at.

A route reaching one of the three names **only through a path parameter**
no longer wins; a literally declared `routes "/metrics"` still does, which
is the half of §4.0.3 that was already right. §4.0.2 promises an operator
these paths without reading the source, and a pattern nobody aimed at them
must not take that away.

### Also

- `response.duration_ms()` / `response.duration_us()` in an `after` block
  (builtins.md §7). An `after` block exists to observe the response and how
  long it took is half of that; without it the only honest thing a
  telemetry row could say about latency was nothing. jwc-shortener wrote a
  hardcoded zero into 1.48M rows and every percentile from them was a zero.

### Known, not fixed

- `raw(sql, …) as { … }` (writes.md §6.3) does not parse. Both examples in
  that clause are fenced `no-compile`, which is why no test caught it.
- `jwc add` produces a project that cannot compile: it vendors sources into
  `jwc_packages/<name>/` **and** records the dependency, and the workspace
  walker then loads those sources as ordinary program files — so `import
  <name>` is both a local namespace and a package, which is `E0203`.

## [0.9.8] — `migrate down` — 2026-08-21

`jwc migrate down` could not roll back an ordinary schema, and the error
it printed described none of the three reasons why. Found by installing
the v0.9.7 release and running it against a real Postgres; each fault is
now pinned by a test that fails without its fix.

### Fixed

- **A rollback drops tables in dependency order.** The drops came out in
  the diff's order, which is alphabetical, so `auth.accounts` preceded
  the `org.members` and `org.invites` holding foreign keys into it and
  Postgres refused. `DROP TABLE` is now ordered so a table goes before
  everything it references — Kahn's algorithm over the foreign keys of
  the tables this migration drops, always taking the lowest-index ready
  node so two runs stay byte-identical (§10.1). A foreign-key cycle has
  no valid `DROP TABLE` order at all; its members keep their original
  order and Postgres reports it, rather than the generator inventing a
  sequence that cannot work.

- **A trigger's function is dropped after the trigger.** Phase 9 emits
  `DROP FUNCTION` and `DROP TABLE` into one bucket and the function came
  first, so Postgres refused to drop it while the trigger three
  statements below still referenced it. Any schema with an
  `on update now()` column was affected; the sample application has one.

- **A failed migration reports its own error.** A statement failing
  inside the migration's transaction leaves the connection in an aborted
  transaction, where the `pg_advisory_unlock` on the way out answers
  `current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of
  transaction block`. That was propagated with `?`, so it replaced the
  real diagnosis — the same text for every possible cause, naming
  neither the statement nor the dependency. The unlock is now
  best-effort on the failure path and the original error survives. This
  is what had been hiding the two faults above.

- **The release body carries one copy of its notes.** `release.yml` set
  `generate_release_notes` on a step that runs once per target, and the
  action appends the generated notes each time it runs against a release
  that already exists. The v0.9.7 body has four copies of "What's
  Changed"; one leg of the matrix asks for them now.

### Testing

`the_sample_migrates_from_nothing` applied the conformance corpus and
verified it, then stopped — it never rolled back, and that is the gap all
three faults shipped through. It now takes the sample back down and
asserts every schema is empty. Two further tests cover the function
ordering and the error masking directly.

## [0.9.7] — the 1.0 language, implemented — 2026-08-20

**BREAKING: every 0.9.x program stops compiling.** v0.25.0 replaced the
grammar with the one in `docs/spec/v1/` and deleted the old front-end.
`entity`, `dbcontext`, `with`, `via`, `validate body`, `new … from`,
`patch`, `group`, `mount` and `dome` are gone; the compiler names the
replacement rather than accepting them. There is no codemod — the shapes
do not map one-to-one, which is why the redesign happened. 0.9.x
documentation is archived under `docs/archive-0.9/`, and a 0.9.6 binary
still runs 0.9.6 programs.

> `SEMVER.md` calls a patch bump "nothing a user-written program can
> observe a behavioural change from", and this is the opposite of that.
> The number is the maintainer's call and it is `0.9.7`; the break is
> written down here so nobody meets it by surprise.

The section this replaces opened with **"No code changes. The language
design for 1.0 is now in the repository."** That was true when it was
written and stopped being true eleven releases ago. v0.20.0 through
v0.29.0 built the language that design describes, and none of it was
recorded here — a changelog that says "no code changes" over a rewritten
compiler is worse than no changelog, because it is read and believed.

Releases below in order. `ROADMAP.md` carries the done-criteria each was
held to and the reasoning behind the calls; this is the summary.

### v0.20.0 — the specification

56 unanswered semantic questions, answered or marked `DEFERRED` with what
1.0 does instead. Seventeen normative documents under `docs/spec/v1/`, a
~1100-line sample application, and `spec-coverage.json` mapping every
construct the sample uses to the clause that defines it.

### v0.21.0 — the vocabulary

Lexer, AST, parser and formatter for the new grammar. No reserved words:
`route`, `key`, `max`, `date` and `int` are all legal identifiers, because
a reserved-word list would forbid the specification's own examples.

### v0.22.0 — deterministic DDL

Five DDL object classes emitted in a fixed order, with generated constraint
and index names derived from canonical predicate text — so `a and b` and
`b and a` produce the same name and therefore no spurious migration.

### v0.23.0 — the type checker

The `Raw` / `Record` lattice, `T?` propagation, flow narrowing, and name
resolution over a flat declaration space where `import` is checked but does
not scope.

### v0.24.0 — the runtime

Routing, middleware chains with `after` blocks, the error model with typed
`throw` and a compile-time raise set, and single-table CRUD.

### v0.25.0 — the query compiler

The largest release: alias and join trees, `as one` / `as many` laterals,
aggregate modes, view compilation with two-stage pushdown, raw tracking,
keyset pagination, `exists`, and the `raw(…)` escape hatch. **The 0.9.x
front-end was deleted at the cutover** — the two lived side by side for
four releases so the old suite stayed green, and that reason expired the
moment the new one could run the sample.

### v0.26.0 — migrations

Snapshot, diff, ten-phase emission, declared renames, and the applier:
`up` / `down` / `status` / `verify`, under an advisory lock. Destructive
statements emit `-- irreversible` and stop rather than promising a
reversal that the dropped data makes impossible. A property test runs
random edit sequences and asserts a migrated database equals a created one.

### v0.27.0 — tooling

`jwc explain` per route or function, `JWC_LOG_SQL`, `debug.dump`,
`jwc lint --constraints`, `jwc openapi`, and a language server with
hover-to-SQL.

### v0.28.0 — tests and packages

`test` blocks, each inside its own transaction, rolled back whether it
passed, failed or faulted — which is the whole of the isolation model and
what makes the order irrelevant. `jwc login` / `publish` / `add`, with the
downloaded archive verified against a checksum from a **separate** request,
and a closed list of what a package may declare: no `table`, because
installing a dependency must never apply someone else's schema change to
your database.

### v0.29.0 — hardening

Hash builtins split by purpose, rate-limit keys on both IP and identity,
the `server { }` block, and a threat model. The finding was a **timing
oracle in `login`**: an unknown address returned before reaching Argon2id
at 2.4 ms against 415.8 ms for a known one — 172×, under a code comment
asserting the two were indistinguishable. Both branches verify now, the
miss against a decoy hash, at 410.9 ms and 414.8 ms.

---

### After v0.29.0 — the fix pass in this release

Everything below came out of running things that had never been run.

#### Fixed — silent wrong answers

- **`db::run_on` swallowed a column-type error.** `try_get::<_,
  Option<String>>(0).unwrap_or(None)` turned a projection that was wrong
  into *no rows*: 404 from `Shape::First`, `[]` from `Shape::Rows`, both
  indistinguishable from an empty table. A generator bug would have looked
  like missing data everywhere it touched.
- **`redis.rate_limit()` returned `true` unconditionally**, and
  `redis.enabled()` `false`; `get` / `set` / `del` / `incr` / `expire` were
  not implemented at all, so they typechecked and faulted at request time.
  A rate limiter written against the documented API admitted every request
  and nothing said so. The driver in `src/redis_engine.rs` was complete —
  **nothing ever called `init_from_env`**, so it was dead code. The
  sample's own `RateLimit` middleware had therefore never limited anything.
- **The diagnostic printer panicked on the file it was describing.** A
  non-ASCII character produced a one-byte span landing *inside* it, and
  `SourceFile::line_col` sliced there — so the compiler crashed while
  rendering the error it had just produced, mojibake included.

#### Added

- **`/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`** (config.md §4), at fixed paths, not
  declarable. v1 had served none of them since the cutover: no liveness
  probe, no readiness probe, and no way to see the pool —
  `engine::pool_status()` existed and nothing exposed it, which is why the
  soak's zero-pool-leaks criterion had never been checked. A declared route
  still wins.
- **`server { tls { … } }` and `header_timeout` are enforced** rather than
  refusing to boot. Both were hidden under `axum::serve`; writing out the
  accept loop over `hyper-util` got both and cost no new dependency.
- **`server { bind }`** — the listener address was hardcoded to `0.0.0.0`,
  so a development machine had no way to stay off its own network.
- **`E1206`** — an unknown `server { }` key. `init()` has had `E1202` for
  this since config.md was written; the server block had nothing, and
  `trusted_proxie` passed `jwc check` clean while leaving `client_ip()`
  reporting the proxy for every request.

#### Fixed — tests that never ran

Pointed at a real Postgres for the first time, **21 tests across 7 suites
failed**, none of them in the code under test: three suites composed their
psql command as `<uri> -d <db>`, which psql reads as a whole new connection
target and so fell back to the default unix socket; two shared one database
with no mutex; two more shared a scratch-database pair; and `http_golden`
asserted a route count written down as 25 against a sample that had grown
to 26.

Underneath that, **seven suites were named in no CI job at all** —
`hardening` among them — and four more ran only without the database they
need. `every_test_suite_is_named_in_ci` and
`the_spec_coverage_map_is_current` now check both claims against the
repository; the second found its own instance immediately.

#### Fixed — the soak

Closed once as "cannot run in this environment". The harness had five bugs,
each of the never-executed kind: `--format=json` without `-p r` is not
JSON; the readiness probe was `curl --fail` on a path the sample does not
declare; a port already in use satisfied that probe; `kill -TERM` on an
exited child ended the run under `set -e`; and absent latency percentiles
read as 0.00 forever. `analyze.py` also required pandas and never checked
the pool criterion.

It runs now. Eight cycles with a graceful restart between each, against the
sample on real Postgres and Redis: **480,051 requests, 480,051 2xx, zero
lost**, RSS drift 3.2%, pool waiting 0. That is twelve minutes, not
twenty-four hours, and too short for a slow leak — but the criterion is no
longer *unmeasured*.

## [0.9.6] — A harness that can fail both backends at once

0.9.5 fixed five interpreter/native divergences that an outside user found by
running into them. This release is about why *we* did not find them, and the
answer is that the parity tests could not have.

### Added

**`tests/differential.rs` — both backends, compiled and run.** Every existing
parity test string-matches the *emitted Rust source* and deliberately never
invokes cargo on it. That leaves two blind spots, and all five of the 0.9.5
bugs lived in both:

* **The call shape was right and the behaviour was wrong.**
  `badRequest({...})` emitted a well-formed `jwc_b_bad_request(...)` on both
  backends. No substring assertion can see the difference.
* **The golden value was one of the backends.** `native_parity.rs` says it
  outright: "we treat the interpreter's stdout as the source of truth". In
  all five bugs the interpreter was the wrong side, so a harness anchored to
  it would have certified the bug and moved on.

The new suite cargo-builds the generated crate, runs the binary, and drives
real HTTP at it and at `jwc run`. Both are compared against expectations
declared in the fixture — neither backend votes, so a case where both agree
and both are wrong still fails. It is opt-in (`JWC_DIFFERENTIAL=1`) because
each case shells out to cargo.

It found a new divergence on its first run, and gave the two defects TODO.md
had been carrying a place to live. Six cases ship: `error_helpers`, `redirect`,
`len_shapes`, `request_body`, `validate_body`, `field_write`.

### Fixed

**Native field assignment crashed on a row read back from the database.**
Read-modify-write — the shape every REST update handler is written in — blew up
under `--native` and worked under `jwc run`:

```jwc
let existing = select Todo from AppDb.Todo where Todo.id == @id first;
existing.title = req.title;   // HTTP 500 natively, fine under `jwc run`
update existing in AppDb.Todo;
```

`select ... first` yields `V::RawJson`. `jwc_get_field` was taught to parse
that on access, but `jwc_set_field` kept its two `Object` / `Record` arms and
`panic!`d on everything else — so reads started working while writes kept
failing, which is a worse state than both being broken. TODO.md reports it on
0.8.7 as a worker panic that dropped the connection; on 0.9.x it is caught and
answers 500. `tests/differential/cases/field_write.*` covers it and was
verified to fail without the fix.

**Native error helpers did not wrap a string argument.** `notFound("gone")`
returned the bare bytes `gone` as `text/plain` under `--native` and
`{"error":"gone"}` as `application/json` under `jwc run` — same helper, same
argument, a body no client can parse the same way twice. The same held for
`badRequest`, `internalError`, `unauthorized` and `forbidden`. Object
arguments already agreed, which is exactly why it survived 0.9.5's review:
the divergence only appears with a string, and a string is the spelling most
of the docs use. Native now goes through a shared `error_envelope` that
mirrors the interpreter's `error_response`, including the no-argument
defaults.

**`len()` was rejected by the native backend.** It carried its own registry
row with `native: false` while `length` — the identical interpreter body —
was `native: true`. The third instance of one built-in split across two
`BuiltinDef` rows, after `setConnectionString` in 0.9.5. `len` is now an
alias, and CLAUDE.md documents the pattern so the next one does not happen.

**`length()` counted characters natively, elements in the interpreter.** A
string that parses as a JSON array or object counts its elements under
`jwc run` and its characters under `--native`. This one was live in shipped
code, not merely unimplemented: `length(request_body())` returned the field
count on one backend and the byte-ish length on the other.

**`request_body()` had no native implementation.** Programs using it ran
under `jwc run` and failed to compile under `--native`. Implemented, keeping
it distinct from `body()` — this is the raw string, `body()` is the parsed
value — including the contract that an absent body yields the literal string
`"null"`.

**`jwc build --native` ignored `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`.** The binary path was
hardcoded to `<workspace>/target`, so anyone exporting the variable globally
— a single shared target dir across projects is a common setup — got a full
successful compile followed by `cargo reported success but binary not found`,
naming a path that legitimately did not exist. Found by the new harness,
which sets it to share one target dir across cases.

**A non-native built-in was reported as a typo.** `len(xs)` failed with
`unknown function — did you mean \`env\`?`. It was neither unknown nor
anything like `env`; it was a documented built-in with no native
implementation. Registry-known names that carry `native: false` now say so.

### Added — arm64 Linux

`jwc` now ships prebuilt for **aarch64 Linux**, glibc and musl, alongside the
existing x86_64 Linux and Windows builds. Raspberry Pi, Ampere, Graviton and
Android shells stop dead-ending on:

```
Unsupported platform: linux-aarch64.
```

The Docker images are multi-arch again (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`).

This is a deliberate change to a **Non-goal**. `ROADMAP.md` refused a
cross-target matrix on the grounds that *"Linux x86_64 (glibc + musl) +
Docker amd64/arm64 is enough"* — but the Docker arm64 leg had been dropped
because building it under QEMU emulation hung for 30+ minutes. The policy
pointed at an escape hatch that did not exist, so arm64 users had no path at
all: no binary, no image. Both now exist, built on native ARM runners rather
than emulated. Windows-ARM, macOS-ARM and FreeBSD remain non-goals.

Two details that were wrong independently of architecture:

* `install.sh` told you to run `./install-from-source.sh` after failing.
  You reach that message by piping the script from `curl`, so there is no
  such file on disk — the advice could not be followed. It now gives the
  clone first, and a `docker run` line that needs no toolchain.
* The Docker images labelled `org.opencontainers.image.source` with the
  repository's pre-move URL. It is derived from the running repo now.

The manifest merge verifies both architectures are present and fails the job
otherwise, so a silently amd64-only image cannot ship again.

### Fixed — the Linux binaries required a very new glibc

v0.9.6's glibc builds require **GLIBC_2.39**, so they install cleanly and then
refuse to start:

```
jwc: /lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.39' not found
```

Found on an arm64 Android shell, but it was never an arm64 problem — the
shipped `x86_64-linux` binary needs 2.39 too. That is Ubuntu 24.04's glibc, so
the release did not run on Ubuntu 22.04 (2.35), Debian 12 (2.36), RHEL 9 or
Amazon Linux 2023 (2.34) on either architecture. The cause was `ubuntu-latest`
moving to 24.04: a glibc binary runs on its build glibc or newer, never older.

Two changes:

* **Releases build glibc targets on the oldest supported runner** —
  `ubuntu-22.04` and `ubuntu-22.04-arm`, glibc 2.35, covering all of the above.
  The musl targets stay on the current image; they link libc statically, so
  the runner's version is irrelevant. The matrix carries a comment saying not
  to "upgrade" the pins, because doing so silently drops distributions.

* **The installer no longer leaves a binary that cannot run.** It executes
  `jwc --version` after installing and, on failure, re-installs the static
  musl build automatically. This is a smoke test rather than an
  `ldd --version` comparison on purpose: a minimum-glibc constant would have
  to be kept in sync with the release runner and would drift silently, while
  asking the binary whether it runs cannot.

The fallback works against the existing v0.9.6 assets, so affected hosts are
fixed by re-running the installer — no new release required.

### Fixed — the installer 403'd on mobile networks

Resolving "latest" called `api.github.com`, which allows unauthenticated
clients **60 requests per hour per IP**. Carriers put thousands of subscribers
behind one NAT address, so the budget is routinely already spent and the
install dies with:

```
Resolving latest release tag for just-web-code/jwc-lang...
curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 403
```

The same command works from a home network minutes later, which makes it look
like a broken release rather than a shared quota. Reported from an Android
shell on 4G while Windows and WSL on the same account succeeded.

Both installers now follow the `/releases/latest` redirect on github.com,
which resolves the same tag and is not part of that budget. The API remains a
fallback and picks up `GITHUB_TOKEN` when set (5000/hour). If resolution still
fails, the error names the rate limit and shows how to pin `JWC_VERSION`
instead of just saying "failed".

### Fixed — the multi-arch Docker merge (0.9.6 tag)

The `v0.9.6` tag built both architectures for both images and then failed to
publish `jwc`:

```
ERROR: ghcr.io/just-web-code/jwc@sha256:1ee0569e…: not found
```

The merge job selected its digests with `pattern: digests-<image>-*`. One image
is named `jwc` and the other `jwc-runtime`, so `digests-jwc-*` matched
`digests-jwc-runtime-amd64` too: the `jwc` merge collected four digests, two of
them belonging to a different repository, and the registry rejected them.
`jwc-runtime` published fine because its prefix happens to be unique — which is
how the bug hid in a green job next to a red one.

Digests are now downloaded by exact artifact name, and a count check fails with
a legible message instead of a registry 404 that names nothing.

Binaries were unaffected: `Release jwc binaries` published all five targets,
aarch64 included.

### Known — the GHCR packages are private

`docker pull ghcr.io/just-web-code/jwc` is denied for anonymous users; a
GitHub PAT with `read:packages` is required. The docs said Docker was the
no-toolchain escape hatch for macOS and other unsupported platforms, which was
wrong as written — they now show the `docker login` step, and `install.sh` no
longer suggests a `docker run` that would fail. Making the packages public
would remove the step; that is a repository setting, not a code change.

### Changed — canonical repository

Every repository URL, clone command, `raw.githubusercontent.com` install
one-liner and `ghcr.io` image reference now points at **`just-web-code`**.
`install.sh` and `install.ps1` resolved releases from the pre-move
`Nodirbek-Abdulaxadov` owner while the workflows published to the new one, so
the installer and the release pipeline were aimed at different repositories —
the aarch64 assets added above would have landed somewhere the installer never
looked.

Historical mentions are deliberately left alone: the workflow comments
explaining *why* the namespace is resolved at run time, and the changelog
entries recording the old VS Code publisher ID, are the reason those
workarounds exist.

### Fixed — `--target` allowlist had drifted

`aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` was missing from `KNOWN_TARGETS`, so an arm64 host
could install `jwc` and still be refused the static app build its x86_64
counterpart gets. Added, with a note in the source that the two lists must not
drift again.

The docs claimed the allowlist as a flat "supported triples" list.
`aarch64-apple-darwin` is on it and exercised by nothing — no darwin binary is
published, so there is no macOS `jwc` to invoke it from without building the
compiler from source first, and cross-linking to darwin from Linux needs a
macOS SDK. It stays accepted; the docs now say plainly which triples CI
actually covers and which one does not.

### Verified, not changed

TODO.md's `validate body` entry — `pattern(...)` not enforced against a
present, non-matching value, and a validation failure answering HTTP 200 in the
pre-0.7.0 envelope — was fixed in 0.9.5 but had never been regression-tested.
`tests/differential/cases/validate_body.*` now asserts the status line *and*
the envelope shape on both backends across `pattern`, `minLength`, `required`
and the accepted case. That entry asked for exactly this test; it exists now.

### Known

Four issues from the 0.6.3 → 0.8.8 migration remain open in TODO.md, three of
them interpreter-side: `raw_sql` reading only a text first column, unqualified
calls into a dependency namespace, Windows binding `[::]` without clearing
`IPV6_V6ONLY`, and `return { status: N, ... }` answering 200.

Eleven built-ins remain interpreter-only, so `--native` is still not a
superset of `jwc run`: `dispatch`, `http_post`, `send_email`, `db_query`,
`set_json_field`, and the job queue (`register_job_handler`, `enqueue`,
`enqueue_urgent`, `job_count`, `dlq_count`, `dlq_drain`). They now fail with
an accurate message instead of a misleading one.

The 0.9.5 "Known" items still stand: `jwc check` accepts calls to functions
that do not exist, and `first(rows).value` is a parse error.

## [0.9.5] — What the interpreter got wrong

From an outside user's first real project. Every fix here is a case where
`jwc run` behaved differently from `jwc build --native`, and the interpreter
was the one that was wrong — which matters more than the direction suggests,
because the interpreter is what runs on a machine with no Rust toolchain.

### Fixed

**`badRequest(obj)` and `internalError(obj)` double-encoded an object body.**
Both stringified their argument unconditionally, so `badRequest({ got: "x" })`
came back as `{"error":"{\"got\":\"x\"}"}` — an object JSON-encoded and
then stuffed into a string field, forcing the client to parse the body twice.
`notFound`, `unauthorized`, `forbidden` and `ok` all went through
`error_response` and were correct, and native was correct for every one of
them.

**`statusCode(302, { Location: url })` did not redirect.** The redirect branch
matched on `Value::Str` holding JSON, which is what object literals used to
evaluate to; they now build a `Value::Record`, so nothing matched and the call
fell through to the body path — a 302 status line, no `Location` header, and
the header map served as the response body. Native was unaffected.

**`take(xs, n)` rejected arrays on both backends.** `first` and `last` have
always accepted either, and the reference groups all three together, so
`take(rows, 5)` — the obvious pagination shape — read as a mistake in the
caller's code. A string still slices by character.

**`set_connection_string` and `setConnectionString` disagreed about native
support.** They were two registry rows, the snake_case one marked
`native: false`, so one spelling of one built-in compiled and the other was
rejected as an unknown function with a "did you mean" pointing at the name
the author had effectively already written. It is now an alias, like
`setContext` / `set_context`.

**A bare `setConnectionString()` broke the native build.** The Postgres
prelude was gated on declaring a dbcontext or entity, so a program that
called the built-in without declaring one emitted a crate referencing
`jwc_b_setConnectionString` without defining it. The build then failed inside
*generated* Rust with `error[E0425]: cannot find function` — an internal
symbol the author never wrote. The prelude is now gated on use as well as on
declarations.

### Known

`jwc check` still accepts a call to a function that does not exist; it fails
at runtime with `Unknown function`. `typecheck::check_call` returns `Ok(())`
for any name that is neither a built-in nor a known user function, and it
cannot simply reject them: the same `None` means "ambiguous across
namespaces", and `jwc check <file>` sees one file of a multi-file project.
The fix belongs in `lint.rs` as a warning, where the whole project is loaded.

## [0.9.4] — The log writer's ceiling

A saturation benchmark reported the buffered writer persisting **46%** of
offered rows at 106k req/s. Chasing that turned up five separate faults,
four of them silent.

### Fixed

**`log_insert` wrote nothing at all outside `jwc serve`.** The writer was
started only by `server::serve`, so a program that does not serve — a batch
job under `jwc run` — got `false` from every call and wrote zero rows, with
no writer around to even count them as dropped. It now starts on first push,
matching the AOT prelude, which always did.

**The writer's ceiling was one batch per database round-trip.** The drain
loop awaited each `INSERT` before looking at the channel again, so for the
whole round-trip nothing drained and arrivals had only the channel to sit
in. Up to `JWC_LOG_CONCURRENCY` (default 4) batches now overlap. Measured on
a saturation harness, 20 rows per request against local Postgres:

| | rows/s | of offered |
|---|---|---|
| batch 500, serial (0.9.3) | 50,413 | 11% |
| batch 2000, serial | 85,997 | 19% |
| **batch 2000, 4 in flight** | **178,820** | **74%** |

**A varying batch size defeated the prepared-statement cache.** The loop took
one row per `select!` poll, so the number of `VALUES` tuples tracked arrival
timing — a different SQL string every time, a miss in deadpool's
`prepare_cached` map every time, and an entry added that nothing would reuse.
`recv_many` drains up to a full batch at once, so a saturated writer emits
the same statement repeatedly.

**`JWC_LOG_BATCH` could build a statement Postgres refuses.** Rows × columns
has to stay under 65535 bound parameters and the row count alone cannot
guarantee it: 5000 rows of a 20-column entity is 100k parameters and the
whole batch failed at execute time. Batches are now chunked to fit, so the
row limit and the entity's width are independent again. The default rises
500 → 2000.

**A failed batch killed the native writer permanently.** `jwc_db_exec`
panics on error, and the AOT drain loop is a spawned task with no guard above
it, so one bad statement ended the writer for the life of the process and
every later `log_insert` silently dropped. Telemetry writes now use a
non-panicking exec and count failures.

**Native `/metrics` published three log-writer series to the interpreter's
six.** `jwc_log_written_total`, `jwc_log_batches_total` and
`jwc_log_failed_total` were interpreter-only — and `written ÷ batches` is
exactly the number that says whether the limit is statement overhead or the
database, so diagnosing a native build meant re-running it on the
interpreter.

### Added

**`response_duration_us()`.** `response_duration_ms()` cannot resolve a
handler that answers in under a millisecond: a shortener logging 1.48M
requests recorded min 0, max 1, mean 0.00, and every percentile built on that
column was zero. The value was measured all along — the unit was too coarse.

**`migrate new` generated an unapplicable `ADD COLUMN`.** A NOT NULL column
added to a table that already has rows needs a backfill default, or Postgres
refuses with `column "x" of relation "t" contains null values`. The migration
generated cleanly and only failed on the machine with production data — the
one place you least want to be hand-editing SQL. It now carries the type's
zero and drops the default on the next statement, so the migrated schema
still matches what `gen-sql` emits for a fresh database. Verified against a
900k-row table.

**A path-length pre-check on Windows native builds.** cargo nests build
artefacts ~140 characters below the workspace, which crosses `MAX_PATH` for a
project in a deep directory. The build reached the link step and died with
`LNK1104` naming a file rather than the path length. It now fails up front
with the budget, the measured length, and both fixes.

## [0.9.3] — The rest of the native-parity gaps

Everything here is `--native` catching up to the interpreter. Each one
returned a well-formed response with the wrong contents, status, or header,
which is why they read as application bugs rather than compiler faults.

### Fixed

**`validate body` failures were served as HTTP 200.** Codegen returned a
bare `{error, fields, status: 400}` object; `jwc_to_response` has no reason
to treat that as anything but a plain JSON value, so the status line said
`200 OK` while the body claimed 400. Any client branching on `res.ok` read
a rejected signup as a successful one. Native now answers with the shared
envelope through `make_response(400, …)` — `{code, details, error, status}`,
byte for byte what `http_error::validation_failed` produces.

The per-rule messages moved with it. Native emitted `minLength 3` where the
interpreter writes `minLength(3)`, reported *every* failing rule per field
where `run_validation_rules` breaks on the first, and silently skipped type
errors: `{"name": 5}` passed `minLength(3)` and `{"age": "abc"}` passed
`min(18)`, both because the emitted check only looked at the arm it wanted.

**A short-circuiting middleware skipped the after-chain.** `dispatch.rs`
breaks out of the request-phase loop on the first middleware that answers,
then runs the after-chain over every declared middleware anyway. Native's
`return __mw` jumped straight out of `route_N_inner` — the same class of bug
as the route-body `return` fixed in 0.9.2, one layer up. jwc-shortener
served 92,675 rate-limited requests and wrote zero `api_call` rows, so
throttling was invisible in the analytics. The short-circuit response is now
parked and stands in for the route body, which also means `response_status()`
inside `after { }` reads the 429 rather than a handler status that never
happened. Routes with no after-block anywhere in the chain keep the flat
early `return` and pay nothing.

**Bare string and null responses got the wrong content-type.** `server.rs`
defaults every response without an explicit type to `application/json`;
native guessed `text/plain; charset=utf-8` for a `V::Str`. A handler that
hand-builds a JSON document and returns the string — jwc-shortener's
`/openapi.json` — served the right bytes under the wrong header, and Swagger
UI refused the spec from the native binary only. A handler that returns
nothing now sends the JSON document `null` rather than an empty body, also
matching the interpreter. Handlers wanting another type say so with
`text(v)`, `html(v)`, or `response(v, "image/svg+xml")`.

**`select … first` results read back as null.** `jwc_get_field` handled
`V::Object` and `V::Record` and sent everything else to `_ => V::Null`, but a
row from the database arrives as `V::RawJson` and a dynamic object as
`V::Str`. Every field read off a query result was empty under `--native`;
jwc-shortener's `/api/links/{code}` served nulls in production. `datetime`
columns were read as `String` in the same path — `TIMESTAMPTZ` has no
`FromSql for String`, so the read could only fail, and `unwrap_or_default`
turned the failure into `""`.

**`redis_eval` re-uploaded the script on every call.** It issued a plain
`EVAL`, so a rate limiter running one script per request put the script's
bytes on the wire forever. Both backends now use `redis::Script`, which
sends `EVALSHA` and falls back once on `NOSCRIPT`.

**`cargo run -- serve` aborted on a stack overflow.** tokio's default
worker stack is 2 MiB, and the `#[async_recursion]` evaluator nests one
boxed future per expression node — which fits in an optimised build and
does not fit in a debug one. jwc-shortener's redirect route overflowed and
killed the process on the *first* request under a debug build while serving
normally from a release build, which reads as a broken application rather
than a profile artefact. Server workers now get 8 MiB, which on Linux is
address space rather than committed memory.

### Added

**Redis pool gauges on native `/metrics`.** `jwc_redis_pool_size` /
`_available` / `_max_size` / `_waiting`, alongside the Postgres pool series
the endpoint already published. Absent rather than zeroed when Redis is not
configured, matching the interpreter.

## [0.9.2] — Request logging off the critical path, and three native-parity fixes

### Fixed

**`pattern(...)` was not enforced under `--native`.** `emit_validate_body`
compiled the rule to an is-it-a-string check and discarded the regex, because
the generated crate had no regex dependency. Every other rule was emitted
faithfully, so the gap was invisible: `jwc check` accepted it, the interpreter
honoured it, only the shipped binary ignored it. A program using `pattern` as
a security boundary had none — jwc-shortener's native build accepted
`javascript:` URLs and redirected to them. `regex` is now a conditional
dependency gated on the program using `pattern`, compiled once per call site
behind a `OnceLock`. Semantics now match `runner::validation` exactly,
including a null field passing (that is `required`'s job) — which the old
codegen also got wrong, in the other direction.

**Middleware `after { }` blocks never ran under `--native`.** A route body's
`return` lowers to a real Rust `return`, and the body was emitted inline into
`route_N_inner`, so it exited past the response-status capture and the whole
after-chain. Nearly every route ends in `return`, so the response phase simply
did not happen. Route bodies with an after-chain are now lifted into their own
`async fn`.

**Source discovery walked into nested projects.** A vendored dependency —
a subdirectory with its own manifest — was loaded twice: once as a plain
project source, landing in `<root>` because package files declare no namespace
of their own, and once through dependency resolution. The duplicate broke
visibility, so the package's own call to a `private` helper failed with
`E021`. jwc-shortener had been unbuildable with its own compiler.

**Feature detection was blind to two places.** `program_calls_any` did not walk
middleware `after_body`, and did not recurse into `savepoint { }`. Harmless
while every AOT prelude shipped unconditionally; a real fault now that they are
gated, since codegen would emit a call to a `jwc_b_*` that was never included.

### Added

**`GET /metrics` on native builds.** Serves the buffered-writer series and the
Postgres pool. Registered before the user's routes — the router returns the
first match, so a catch-all like `route GET "/{code}"` otherwise swallows it —
and skipped entirely when the program declares its own `/metrics`, matching
`server.rs::route_owned_by_user`. Narrower than the interpreter's endpoint:
request counters live in `ServerMetrics` and have no native counterpart.

**`log_insert(Entity, record)` — buffered, batched telemetry writes.** A
request-logging middleware that calls `insert` puts a database round-trip on
the critical path: `runner/dispatch.rs` awaits middleware `after { }` blocks
*before* `dispatch_route` returns, so the client waits for its own log row.
`log_insert` hands the row to a bounded channel and a single background
consumer writes it in batches.

One consumer, not a task per row — spawning per row fixes latency and nothing
else: the same number of `INSERT`s still run, they compete for the pool that
real requests need, and a traffic spike spawns unbounded background work.
A bounded channel gives batching, one connection, and an explicit policy when
the writer falls behind.

Durability is the trade: rows are lost on crash (at most `JWC_LOG_FLUSH_MS`
worth) and dropped under sustained overload. That is why this is a separate
built-in rather than a mode of `insert` — the call site states which
semantics it wants. Drops are counted, not silent.

- New env vars `JWC_LOG_QUEUE` / `JWC_LOG_BATCH` / `JWC_LOG_FLUSH_MS`.
- New `/metrics` series: `jwc_log_queue_depth`, `jwc_log_queue_capacity`,
  `jwc_log_dropped_total`, `jwc_log_written_total`, `jwc_log_failed_total`,
  `jwc_log_batches_total` — absent entirely until the writer runs, so "not
  buffering" reads differently from "buffering nothing".
- New `error[E023]`: the entity argument must be a string literal, because
  both backends resolve its schema at build time.
- Works identically under `jwc run` and `jwc build --native`.

### Changed

**`http_get` / `fetch_json` moved into their own AOT prelude block.** They
were emitted unconditionally, so `reqwest` was a dependency of every
generated crate and a hello-world compiled reqwest → hyper → h2 → tower →
rustls before the linker discarded it. LTO recovered the binary size; nothing
recovered the compile time. `needs_http_client` had been computed and then
thrown away with `let _ =` — it is now honoured, and `url` follows the same
gate.

Crypto still pulls the block in: the JWKS fetch calls `jwc_http_client` and
`jwc_check_outbound_url`, so `needs_crypto` implies HTTP whether or not the
program calls `http_get` itself.

**Generated crates enumerate their tokio features** instead of taking
`features = ["full"]`. The prelude genuinely uses most of it — `fs` for the
file built-ins, `io-std` for `console.*`, `signal` for graceful shutdown,
`macros` for the emitted `#[tokio::main]` — so only `process` and
`parking_lot` fall out. A small win next to dropping reqwest, but the
manifest now says what the crate actually uses.

## [0.9.0] — Redis, as a core-tier driver

### Added

**Redis, as a core-tier driver** (`docs/spec/ecosystem.md` Faza 1). Nine
built-ins — `redis_get`, `redis_set`, `redis_del`, `redis_exists`,
`redis_incr`, `redis_expire`, `redis_eval`, `redis_ping`,
`redis_enabled` — in both the interpreter and `jwc build --native`.

This is the shared-state counterpart to the in-process `cache_*` family.
Same key/value shape and the same `ttl_secs == 0 means no expiry` contract,
so code can move between them, but the state lives in Redis and every
replica sees it. A rate limit that read 100/min per pod now reads 100/min
across the deployment.

Redis is behind a **`redis` Cargo feature, off by default**, so the default
build pulls in neither `redis` nor `deadpool-redis`. The built-in *rows* are
not gated — gating them would make `jwc check` accept or reject the same
program depending on how the binary was compiled. A binary built without
the feature warns at boot when `JWC_REDIS_URL` is set, then fails
`redis_*` calls with a message naming the missing flag.

- `rediss://` TLS via rustls with bundled webpki roots, so it works in a
  scratch/distroless container.
- Transient failures (dropped connection, timeout, `LOADING`, cluster
  `MOVED`/`ASK`) retry with exponential backoff; permanent ones don't.
- New error kinds: `RedisError`, `RedisError.ConnectionFailure`,
  `RedisError.TimedOut`, `RedisError.NoScript`, `RedisError.LoadingError`.
- `/readyz` probes Redis **only when configured**, so already-deployed apps
  keep their existing readiness behaviour on upgrade.
- `/metrics` gains `jwc_redis_pool_{size,available,max_size,waiting}`,
  emitted only when Redis is configured.
- New env vars: `JWC_REDIS_URL`, `JWC_REDIS_POOL_SIZE`,
  `JWC_REDIS_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `JWC_REDIS_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS`.
  `JWC_REDIS_URL` is redacted by `jwc config` — its userinfo carries a
  password.

`redis_lpush` / `redis_brpop` are deliberately absent: `BRPOP` blocks,
holding a pool connection for its whole timeout and starving the pool it
came from. Both belong with the durable queue's Redis backend.

See [`docs/archive-0.9/deployment/redis.md`](docs/archive-0.9/deployment/redis.md).

### Changed

- **`JWC_REDIS_URL` joins the `jwc config` redaction list.** It was
  previously possible for a connection string with an inline password to
  print in full, because the redaction needles matched `DATABASE_URL` but
  had no entry for Redis.

### Fixed

- **A package's `tests/` no longer breaks its consumers.** `ecosystem.md`
  §3.7 tells package authors to ship conformance cases as
  `tests/case_*.jwc`, each with its own `main()` so it can be run — but
  source discovery merged those into whatever depended on the package,
  failing the load with `E015: Duplicate function name: main`. Via a path
  dependency and via the registry alike, since `jwc publish` includes
  `tests/` in the tarball. A dependency's top-level `tests/` is now
  skipped, as is a `type: "pkg"` project's own when it loads itself, so
  `jwc lint` / `jwc test` work in a package root. An app's `tests/` is
  untouched.

- **W001 no longer reports a library's public API as dead code.**
  `public` is an export; no walk of the package's own sources can see the
  consumers that call it, so every spec-shaped package emitted one
  "defined but never called" warning per exported function. `private` and
  unmarked functions are still checked.

- **`/readyz` names the subsystem that failed.** The 503 body reported
  every failure under a `"db"` key, so a Redis outage read as a database
  one. It now emits `{"status":"not_ready","redis":"..."}` or `"db"` as
  appropriate.

### Internal

- The three copies of the "does this program call built-in X?" AST walk in
  `native_build.rs` are now one `CallScan` over a name list. The copies
  differed only in their name lists, so every new `Expr` variant had to be
  remembered in each of them — and a missed one silently under-reports a
  dependency, leaving a prelude fragment out of a generated crate that then
  fails to compile.

## [0.8.8] — int() stops lying, and console.writeln

### BREAKING

**`int(v)` no longer answers `0` for input that isn't a number.** An
unparseable string now raises, with a message carrying `type error` so it
classifies as `ValidationError` and `catch (e: ValidationError)` reaches
it. Previously `int("abc")` and `int("0")` were indistinguishable, so bad
input travelled on looking like a real number.

Two softenings ship with it, both aimed at the case that surfaced this:

- **Strings are trimmed before parsing.** `console.read()` hands back
  whatever the terminal gave, and a single trailing space was enough to
  make `int` answer `0`. `query_param` / `header` values pick up stray
  whitespace the same way. `int(" 42 ")` is now `42`.
- **`null` propagates instead of becoming `0`.** `int(null)` is `null`, so
  `int(query_param("page"))` stays usable when the parameter is absent.

Call sites that may receive absent or non-numeric input need a guard. The
shipped examples already had one (`if (port_env != "")`); the one that did
not is `int(query_param("count", "10"))` in `examples/csv-export`, which
now returns a catchable error for `?count=abc` instead of silently
computing on zero.

### Added

**`console.writeln(v)`** — `console.write` plus a trailing newline. The
common case, and without it the newline tempts you back to `print`, whose
output goes to the buffer rather than the terminal.

### Fixed

**The `env` default pattern in the stdlib docs never worked.**
`int(env("MAX_ITEMS") || "20")` fails with `'or' expects bool, got
string` — `||` is boolean-only in JWC, and `env()` returns the empty
string for an unset variable rather than `null`, so neither half of that
line was right. Replaced with an explicit `!= ""` guard.

## [0.8.7] — the filesystem and the terminal

### Added

**Console and filesystem built-ins.** Sixteen new functions under three
namespaces, working on both backends:

- `console.write(v)` / `console.error(v)` — write to stdout / stderr
  immediately, no trailing newline. `console.read()` — one line from
  stdin, `null` at EOF.
- `file.read`, `file.write`, `file.append`, `file.exists`, `file.delete`,
  `file.copy`, `file.move`, `file.size`, `file.lines`.
- `directory.list`, `directory.create`, `directory.exists`,
  `directory.delete`.

These are the first builtins with dotted names. That works because the
parser already flattens `a.b(...)` into a single call name for `dome`
namespaces; codegen maps the dot to an underscore
(`console.write` → `jwc_b_console_write`). Each one defers to a
same-named user function, so a project that already declares
`dome file { ... }` keeps its own.

The file and directory operations are `tokio::fs`-backed rather than
`std::fs`, because they are reachable from a route handler and a slow
mount must not park a runtime worker.

`console.write` is not a second spelling of `print`. `print` appends to a
buffer the interpreter flushes after `main()` returns, and a fall-through
route body returns that buffer as the HTTP response; `console.write` goes
straight to the process stdout and never becomes the response. That makes
it the correct way to log from a handler — and means mixing the two
reorders output differently under `jwc run` than in a native binary.
Documented in `docs/docs/stdlib/io.md` and
`docs/spec/aot-scope.md` § Known interpreter / native divergences.

**`IoError` error kind, with `.NotFound`, `.PermissionDenied` and
`.AlreadyExists` subtypes.** Classification comes from a typed
`std::io::Error` downcast, never from the message text — the fallback
substring scan reads `sql` as `DbError` and `url` / `http` as `HttpError`,
so `file.read("/var/backups/app.sql")` failing would otherwise be
reported as a database error.

**Lint `W007`** — `console.read()` in a route or middleware body. stdin is
not request input; the fix is `body()` / `query_param()` / `header()`. The
same call in `main()` is the intended CLI use and does not warn.

### Fixed

**Native `catch (e: Parent)` now matches dotted subtypes.**
`jwc_catch_type_matches` in the AOT prelude compared the catch type to the
error kind with `==`, so `catch (e: DbError)` silently missed every
`DbError.*` in a native binary while catching them fine under `jwc run`.
Existing native builds that catch `DbError` / `HttpError` / `JwtError`
now catch strictly more than before.

**`serve` and `random_int` were missing from the generated builtins
reference.** Neither matched any group predicate in the doc generator, and
a def matching no predicate is dropped silently — the sync test still
passes because generator and checked-in file agree on the omission.

**The builtin-shadowing lint reported the wrong code.** It emitted `W006`,
which is registered as "unreachable statement after top-level `return`", so
`jwc lint --explain` printed an unrelated description and the registered
`W005` was never emitted by anything. Its message also asserted that calls
resolve to the user function, which is true only for `substring` / `take`
and the new `console.*` / `file.*` / `directory.*` families — every other
builtin wins over a same-named user function.

**The documented regenerate command didn't work.** `gen_builtins_doc.rs`
printed `cargo run --bin gen-builtins-doc` (hyphens) in its module docs
and into the generated markdown itself; there is no `[[bin]]` entry, so
cargo resolves the target by filename and only the underscore form runs.
The same file also claimed CI verifies the doc, which it does not —
`builtins_doc_sync` is not in the workflow's test list.

### Security

The `file.*` / `directory.*` builtins pass paths to the OS unchanged —
no jail, no allowlist, no root setting. A path built from request data is
a local-file-include or an arbitrary write. Recorded as an accepted risk
in `docs/spec/threat-model.md` row 6, with the corresponding claim in row
1 corrected. `directory.delete` is non-recursive specifically to avoid a
one-call `rm -rf`.

## [0.8.5] — SQL params bound by column type, and a brand that isn't a placeholder

### BREAKING

**Wrong-arity builtin calls are rejected at `jwc check` (E022).** Four
variadic codegen branches used to pad the missing slots with `V::Null`, so
`raw_sql(sql, a, b)` compiled to a no-op that answered 200 with an empty
body. `min_args` / `max_args` were documented as informational and nothing
enforced them. `typecheck` now checks arity for both backends before
anything is emitted.

A program that passed the wrong number of arguments to a builtin used to
compile and now fails. That is the pre-1.0 minor bump this release carries
(see `SEMVER.md` — "a program that used to compile now fails" is breaking
even when the program was broken). Fixing the arity table first turned up
15 rows that disagreed with the interpreter in both directions;
enforcing those as written would have rejected working programs, so the
table was corrected against the interpreter before the check was turned on.

`serve(host, port)` with the arguments swapped — `serve("0.0.0.0", 8081)`
— took the host as the port and bound `:0`. That is also E022 now instead
of a server nobody can reach.

### Fixed — 500 on the most common route in any application

**`where <int column> == @id` never worked in the interpreter.**
`path_param()` and `query_param()` always return a string, so

```jwc
let id = path_param("id");
select User from AppDb.User where User.id == @id first;
```

bound the text `"1"` against an `integer` column and answered 500 every
time:

```text
cannot convert between the Rust type `alloc::string::String`
and the Postgres type `int4`
```

`build_where_sql` picked the bind type from the value's Rust shape and
never consulted the schema. The native backend has always resolved it from
the entity field (`WhereBuilder::col_kind`); the interpreter now does the
same through `value_to_sql_param_typed`, across `where`, `between`,
`in (...)`, and the atomic `update ... set` RHS. A column that doesn't
resolve — a joined entity's, an ad-hoc table's — falls back to the old
shape-based binding, which is what native does too.

### Fixed — native builds

- **`update ... set` bound the SET value as TEXT for a variable and int8
  for a literal**, so no form of writing an `int` column worked.
  `build_set_rhs_sql_native` now takes the target column's `PgKind`.
- **SET column names were lower-cased** while `gen-sql` quotes the declared
  casing, and the case of a column on the RHS of the same statement was
  kept — so the two halves of one statement disagreed.
- **A DB error unwound into axum and the client got no response at all.**
  The route-level panic guard was emitted only for programs that declare an
  `error_handler`. Every route gets it now, and without a handler it answers
  the same 500 envelope the interpreter does. `route_N_inner` is no longer
  separately boxed, so the guard costs no extra allocation.
- **`[::]` was bound without clearing `IPV6_V6ONLY`**, which Windows
  defaults to on, so `127.0.0.1` was unreachable. Adds `JWC_BIND_HOST`.
- **`setConnectionString(url)` failed to compile** — the native prelude took
  no arguments.
- **`not_found`, `unauthorized` and `forbidden` discarded their message**,
  which the native prelude honoured; two shipped examples pass one.

### Fixed — the DB integration suite has never run

`testcontainers`' `SyncRunner::start` calls `block_on` inside the
`#[tokio::test]` runtime, so a host without Docker got "Cannot start a
runtime from within a runtime" — a panic, not the `Err` the skip path was
written against. All six tests failed everywhere, `continue-on-error` hid it
in CI, and two fixtures had rotted unnoticed (`dependencies: []` against a
map, `integer` where the JWC type is `int`). The suite now takes
`JWC_TEST_DATABASE_URL` like the differential suite, catches the boot panic
so a host without Docker really skips, and is required in CI.

### Added

- **`random_int(end)` / `random_int(start, end)`** in both backends,
  half-open to match `range()`.
- **`unix_timestamp`** reaches native.
- **`JWC_BIND_HOST`** to override the native server's bind address.

### Changed — brand

The hummingbird is teal, and it is the same bird everywhere. `icon.png`,
the docs favicon, the navbar mark and the social card are all generated
from one master (`vscode-extension/logo-source.png`) by
`tools/gen-logo-assets.py`, so the set can't drift the way it did when the
marketplace listing shipped a blank square for two months. The Docusaurus
site drops the last of the scaffolding artwork — default logo, default
social card — and its Infima ramp is built from the two teals sampled off
the artwork.

## [0.8.0] — Query layer: a silent filter bug, `having` aggregates, `distinct`

### Fixed — wrong rows, silently

**`and` / `or` could vanish from a `where` clause.** A comparison's
right-hand side was parsed at the top of the precedence ladder, so it
consumed the `and` belonging to the surrounding WHERE tree:

```text
where Sale.amount > 2 and Sale.amount < 9
  ->  SELECT * FROM "sale" WHERE "amount" > $1
      $1 = (2 and (Sale.amount < 9))
```

The second filter didn't fail — it was folded into the first term's bound
value and disappeared. A query that should have returned one row returned
two, with nothing logged and no error raised. The RHS now parses at
additive precedence, which is what a comparison's right side actually is.

Only literal right-hand sides could reach it. `where col == @param` — the
overwhelmingly common form — returns before that code path, which is why
it went unnoticed. **This bug is present in 0.7.0 and every release before
it.** If you have a `where` with a literal RHS followed by `and` / `or`,
that query has been returning wrong rows; upgrading fixes it with no
source change.

Both backends are fixed by the one parser change — the interpreter and the
AOT codegen build their SQL from the same tree.

### Added

**Aggregates in `having`.** `having count(*) > 5` was a parse error, so the
thing `having` exists for could not be written:

```jwc
select Task { status, total: count(*), effort: sum(hours) }
    from AppDb.Task
    group by status
    having count(*) > 2 and sum(Task.hours) >= 40;
```

An aggregate alias from the projection works too — Postgres rejects an
output alias in `HAVING`, so `having total > 2` is resolved to the
aggregate it names before any SQL is built. Previously that form compiled
and then died at the database with `column "total" does not exist`.

A `having` term that is neither a group key, an aggregate, nor an alias is
now `error[E010]` at `jwc check`. It used to reach Postgres as *"column
must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function"*,
at runtime.

**`select distinct`.**

```jwc
let countries = select distinct Sale { country } from AppDb.Sale;
```

Composes with `where`, `orderby`, `limit`, `group by` and `join`, and is
part of the prepared-statement shape key so the distinct and non-distinct
forms can't share a cached plan. `select distinct count(*)` is rejected at
parse time — de-duplicating a one-row result is always a no-op, and SQL's
`count(distinct col)` is a different construct that isn't emitted yet.

### Changed

`having_with_group_by_validates` asserted `having Sale.amount > @min` while
grouping by `country`. Postgres rejects that program, so the test was
replaced rather than kept: E010 now catches it, and a new case covers
`having` on a real group key.

## [0.7.0] — Field feedback: the DSL, the editor, and the HTTP contract

Two real applications — MyWallet and jwc-shortener — were written against
0.6.x and their authors wrote down every place the language got in the way.
This release works through both lists. Nothing here is speculative; each
item below started as a workaround somebody had already shipped.

### BREAKING

**One error envelope.** The runtime returned three different error shapes
and a client had to handle all of them:

```text
{"errors":{"email":"pattern(...)","password":"minLength(8)"}}   // validate
{"status":404,"error":"Not Found","method":"GET","path":"/x"}   // router
{"error":"category has transactions; delete them first"}        // handler
```

They now share one shape, with `code` as the stable key to branch on
(`validation_failed`, `not_found`, `method_not_allowed`, `timeout`,
`internal_error`):

```text
{ "error": "…", "status": 400, "code": "validation_failed", "details": {…} }
```

Per-field validation detail moved from a top-level `errors` object to
`details`, and every body gained `status` and `code`. A client reading
`.error` for the message keeps working — that key is now present on all of
them, where before it was missing from the validation response.

**A 500 no longer echoes server internals.** The raw error used to go
straight to the caller, putting internal Rust type names and SQL text in
front of anyone who could make a request. The response is now a generic
message pointing at the `x-request-id`; the full error is still logged
server-side, and `JWC_DEBUG_ERRORS=1` restores it locally.

### Language

- **`unique(a, b);`** — table-level composite unique constraints, checked
  against the entity at `jwc check`. A join table's `(taskId, labelId)`
  pair previously had to be enforced by a select-then-insert in
  application code, which is a TOCTOU race.
- **`col int index;`** — index declarations. `gen-sql` emitted no
  `CREATE INDEX` at all, so every foreign-key column was unindexed and
  `where user_id == @u` was a sequential scan.
- **`null`** is accepted as a spelling of `nullable`.
- **`&&` and `||`** as aliases for `and` / `or`; `and` / `or` keep working.
- **`+=` / `-=` / `*=` / `/=`** on plain variables and object fields.
- **`?:` and `??`**, both short-circuiting, so `x ?? expensive()` is safe
  to write. `?:` requires a bool condition; `??` tests for null
  specifically, so `0` and `""` pass through as themselves.
- **`async` / `public` / `private` on dome members.** Domes hold the
  business logic, so `async` was available everywhere except where domain
  code is written.

### HTTP runtime

- **CORS.** There was none — an `OPTIONS` preflight fell through to the
  route table and came back 404, so a browser frontend on another origin
  needed a reverse proxy in front of the server. `JWC_CORS_ORIGINS` turns
  it on; it stays off unless configured, and `*` plus credentials is
  refused at boot rather than silently ignored by the browser.
- **405 for a wrong verb.** A path that existed under another method was
  indistinguishable from one that didn't exist — both 404. Wrong-verb
  requests now get 405 with an `Allow` header.
- **Dual-stack bind.** The listener bound `0.0.0.0`, so a Node dev proxy
  resolving `localhost` to `::1` got `ECONNREFUSED`. It now binds `[::]`
  and falls back to IPv4 where there is no IPv6 stack.

### Database

- **Numeric parameters bind by column type, not value magnitude.** An
  `i64` was passed for every integer regardless of the column, so an
  `int4` column raised `cannot convert between the Rust type i64 and the
  Postgres type int4`. Binding now resolves against the target type;
  `decimal` goes through the value's shortest text form so money doesn't
  pick up `f64` drift.
- **`raw_sql` routes on the statement's result shape.** Anything not
  starting with `select` / `with` went down the exec path, so
  `UPDATE … RETURNING url` returned the affected-row count and discarded
  the column it asked for. A prepared statement with no result columns is
  now an exec, anything else is a query.

### Native AOT

- `jwt_sign` / `jwt_verify` are supported, so a project using Bearer auth
  can be built with `--native` at all.
- Handled errors stop printing panic noise. `try { jwt_verify(…) } catch
  { unauthorized() }` is every auth middleware, and each unauthenticated
  request logged a panic message and a full backtrace for what the
  interpreter reports as nothing. `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` restores the trace.
- `decimal` / `numeric` columns work end to end. They mapped to
  `PgKind::Float`, so writes hit `WrongType` and reads fell through to
  `V::Null` — a money column came back empty with no error raised.
- 404 / 405 use the same JSON envelope as the interpreter.

### Editor

- **`jwc check` and the language server validate against the whole
  project.** Both parsed a single file in isolation, but a JWC project is
  one flat namespace — so on a project `jwc lint`, `jwc test` and
  `jwc run` all accept, the editor showed 12 diagnostics, including the
  same middleware reported as both "declared but never attached" and
  "unknown". Warnings are now published on the file that declares the
  symbol, and validation errors are anchored at their real line.
- **Go-to-definition and rename work across files.** Rename previously
  resolved a sibling file's symbol and then edited only the current one.
- **`textDocument/formatting` is implemented and advertised.** The
  capability was never declared, so format-on-save came back `-32601
  Method not found` and silently did nothing.
- **The extension warns when `jwc-lsp` is older than the extension.** The
  two update through different channels, and a stale binary flags valid
  code as an error in the Problems panel.

### `jwc fmt`

Four ways the formatter produced source the parser then rejected:
`min_length` / `max_length` instead of `minLength` / `maxLength`,
`dbcontext AppDb Postgres;` without the `:`, `pub function` (the lexer
only knows `public`), and `function Dome.member()` — which deleted the
`dome` wrapper, so formatting any comment-free file containing a dome
corrupted it. Files carrying comments took the line-based fallback, which
is the only reason this wasn't constant.

The durable fix is a round-trip test over every declaration form; it is
what found the last three.

### Documentation

A sweep of every fenced example found 37 of 136 unparseable, including the
README's headline example — the first code anyone sees. It used a
`dbcontext AppDb { Notes: Note }` block form and colon-separated entity
fields, neither of which the parser has ever accepted. The surrounding
claim was wrong too: one entity and one dbcontext do not yield CRUD
routes; there is no route generation.

`tests/docs_parse.rs` and `tests/snippets_parse.rs` keep docs and shipped
snippets at zero parse failures. Deliberate excerpts are marked
` ```jwc no-compile `.

### Fixed

- `jwc check main.jwc` failed on a bare relative filename —
  `Path::parent("main.jwc")` is `""`, not `"."`, so the project root came
  back empty and every path built from it was unreadable. `./main.jwc`
  worked. Introduced by the project-aware `check` above, and caught before
  release.

## [0.6.3] — Hotfix: native redirect with `V::Record` header object

`statusCode(3xx, { Location: url })` stopped redirecting on the `--native`
build — it returned `{"Location":"..."}` as a JSON body with no `Location`
header, so browsers never followed it. Object literals lower to `V::Record`
(the shape-deduped fast layout) on the native path, but `jwc_b_status_code`
only special-cased `V::Object` for the 3xx-as-headers branch, so the record
fell through to the JSON-body arm. It now accepts both `V::Object` and
`V::Record`. The interpreter was unaffected (it builds `V::Object`).

Verified end-to-end: a native jwc-shortener binary against Postgres now
returns `HTTP/1.1 302` + `location:` for `GET /:code`.

## [0.6.2] — Hotfix: native AOT Cargo.toml dependency emission

The `--native` build produced a non-compiling crate for any DB-touching app
(`error[E0433]: unresolved module or unlinked crate`), surfaced by the
jwc-shortener Linux CI build. Two bugs in `render_cargo_toml`
(`src/native_build.rs`):

- **`tokio-postgres` / `deadpool-postgres` (and the crypto crates) were
  emitted *after* the `[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies]` table header**,
  so they landed under the Windows-only target and silently vanished on
  Linux/musl. The `[target.'cfg(windows)']` block is now the last thing
  written, after the conditional `needs_db` / `needs_crypto` deps.
- **`serde_json` and `url` were never declared** even though the prelude uses
  them unconditionally (JSON body validation, SSRF host-allowlist parse in
  `http_get`). Both are now direct `[dependencies]`.

Native builds on Windows masked the first bug (the crates resolved via the
`cfg(windows)` table) — only the Linux release path failed.

## [0.6.1] — Hotfix: atomic update-set column case

- **`update CTX.Table set col = expr where …` no longer lowercases the SET
  column name** (or an RHS column self-reference). It previously emitted
  `"columnid"` for a `columnId` column and failed to prepare against camelCase
  schemas (`Failed to prepare SQL statement`); the `hits = hits + 1` example
  never hit it because the column was already lowercase. Columns are now quoted
  as-declared, matching `where` / `insert` / `update`. Surfaced by a task-tracker
  `move` (reorder) endpoint.

## [0.6.0] — Query Layer complete + native query-layer parity

Closes ROADMAP **Phase 11 (Query Layer)** — the last 1.0-blocker. `raw_sql` is
no longer the default escape hatch for cross-table reads. Re-dogfooded on
task-tracker: **0 raw_sql, 0 read-path N+1**.

**Cross-entity queries**

- **Explicit `join Entity on a == b`** (inner equi-join, chainable) with
  table-alias qualification, **aliased columns** (`columnName: Column.name`),
  and **grouped aggregation over a join** — bringing cross-table stats to 0
  raw_sql.
- **`group by` + `having`** with aliased aggregate projection
  (`select Task { status, total: count(*) } group by status`).

**Filters**

- **Optional predicate `op?`** (`status ==? @s`) — a null/empty bound value
  drops the term, so one static query serves every filter combination.
- **Dynamic in-list** — `where col in (@arr)` binds a runtime array as
  `= ANY($1)`.

**Eager loading**

- `with` now covers every nav kind — belongs-to, has-many/one, many-to-many
  (link table) — plus nav projection (hides columns) and nav ordering.
- **Two-level nested `with`** (`select Project with boards.columns`) loads an
  aggregate root and two levels of children in one query.

**Mutations**

- **Atomic `update CTX.Table set col = expr where …`** (no read-modify-write):
  counters, status transitions, and position-shift reorders. RHS supports
  column arithmetic (`position = position + 1`).

**API docs**

- Built-in **`/openapi.json`** (OpenAPI 3.0.3, generated at request time from
  the live routes) and **`/docs`** (Swagger UI). Off via `JWC_DISABLE_OPENAPI`.
  Also offline from the CLI: `jwc openapi` (3.0.3) / `jwc swagger` (3.1).

**Native AOT**

- **Query-layer parity**: nav eager-load (all kinds + nested), grouped
  aggregation, explicit join, and `==?` all codegen the same SQL the
  interpreter emits.
- **Fixed** a call-resolution bug where a camelCase root function call
  (`byStatus()`) wasn't rewritten to its FQN and was rejected as "unknown
  function" — this blocked native builds of any camelCase-named app.
- Still interpreter-only on the native path: `jwt_sign` / `jwt_verify`,
  dynamic in-list (`= ANY`), and a `where` on a joined entity's column.

## [0.5.1] — Release pipeline fixes

No language or runtime changes from v0.5.0 — this release just gets the
publish pipeline green.

- **Docker image build is amd64-only.** The multi-arch build compiled the Rust
  release for arm64 under QEMU emulation and effectively hung (30+ min). arm64
  can return later via a native ARM runner + manifest merge.
- **VS Code extension renamed** `jwc-lang` → `jwc-language`. The Marketplace
  name `jwc-lang` is taken by another publisher, which failed the v0.5.0
  Marketplace publish; the bundled `.vsix` and the publish now use the new id
  `Nodirbek-Abdulaxadov.jwc-language`.

## [0.5.0] — Query Layer: relation loading + grouped aggregation

The first slice of the Query Layer (ROADMAP Phase 11). Navigations now
materialise related rows in a single query, and single-entity grouped
aggregation projects typed result rows. The dogfooding app (task-tracker) was
rewritten on top: read-path N+1 dropped to **zero** and the stats `raw_sql` for
status counts is gone.

**Eager loading via `with`** — a navigation pulls related rows into the result
as a nested JSON value, in one correlated query:

- `posts: List<Post> via Post.userId orderby createdAt desc;` — one-to-many,
  optionally ordered (`json_agg(... ORDER BY ...)`).
- `author: User { id, name } via authorId;` — belongs-to (this entity holds the
  FK; distinguished by a bare, undotted `via` column), with an optional column
  projection so an eager-loaded relation can hide sensitive columns
  (e.g. `passwordHash`).
- `labels: List<Label> via TaskLabel(taskId, labelId);` — many-to-many through a
  join table.

`select Entity with rel1, rel2 from Ctx.Table` returns each row with the
relations nested.

**Grouped aggregation** — an aliased aggregate projection drives the SELECT list,
so `select Task { status, total: count(*) } from Ctx.Task group by status`
returns typed `{ status, total }` rows. `count(*)` / `sum` / `avg` / `min` /
`max`.

**Migrations** — `jwc migrate new` now emits `ALTER TABLE … ADD/DROP CONSTRAINT
… UNIQUE` when a `unique` modifier is added to (or removed from) an existing
column; previously only a fresh `CREATE TABLE` honoured it.

**Release & CI** — the `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` release build vendors OpenSSL
for that target (it had failed at `openssl-sys` since v0.4.8); the VS Code
extension lockfile is back in sync (`npm ci`); and the runner code is
rustfmt/clippy-clean, so `main` CI is green again.

**Docs** — README/docs corrected to the real implementation: `unix_timestamp()`
(not `now_epoch()`), `query_param` returns `""` when absent, `jwt_verify` strips
an optional `Bearer ` prefix, and the `group by` / `having` section reflects what
actually runs.

**Interpreter-only** — the new nav/aggregate query forms run under `jwc run` /
`serve`; `jwc build --native` rejects them with a clear compile error for now.

## [0.4.9] — Runtime correctness fixes (pain-log root causes)

Fixes a cluster of dogfooding-surfaced bugs at their root, each guarded by a
regression test (341 unit tests green).

**Response model**: a body key named `status` is no longer swallowed — the HTTP
status now travels through an internal `__jwc_status__` sentinel (mirroring
`__jwc_content_type__`/`__jwc_body__`), so `json({ status: ... })` and entities
with a `status` column round-trip intact.

**Value model unified**: a row from `select ... first` (a `Record`) is now
accepted by `update <var> in`, `insert`/`delete <var>`, entity-typed function
returns, and entity-typed parameters. The canonical
`let x = select…; x.f = …; update x in T;` pattern — including across a function
boundary — works.

**Schema-aware parameter binding**: `insert`/`update` bind by the column's
declared type instead of guessing from value shape. An ISO-date *string* into a
`varchar` column stays text; a JSON *object* into a `jsonb` column binds as real
`jsonb`.

**Partial / PATCH**: a typed `class` parameter no longer requires every declared
field to be present (presence stays the job of `validate body { … required }`),
so partial PATCH payloads validate.

**Auth**: `jwt_verify` strips an optional `Bearer ` scheme prefix, so handlers
can pass `header("authorization")` straight through.

**Entities**: `unique` column modifier is now honoured end-to-end (DDL +
migration-diff round-trip).

**Pagination**: dynamic `limit`/`offset` values are bound parameters, fixing a
SQL-compile-cache collision that made `offset` silently no-op.

**Ergonomics**: `query_param(name)` returns `""` (not `null`) when absent,
matching `path_param`/`env`. Docs corrected (`for x in xs` has no parentheses;
entity columns use `<name> <type> <modifiers>` with `nullable`/`autoincrement`,
not colon/`?`/`auto`).

## [0.4.8] — Phase 8 developer experience + ecosystem close-out

Bundles the full Phase 8 dev-experience surface from
PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md across eight parallel sprint deliverables
in two batches.

**Deploy**: official multi-arch Docker images on GHCR
(`jwc:0.4.8` + `jwc-runtime:0.4.8`, distroless cc-debian12:nonroot for
the runtime variant), `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` static binary in
every release with `JWC_MUSL=1` install opt-in, k8s
migrate-as-init-container deployment guide.

**Onboarding**: `jwc new <name> --template <empty|api|auth|jobs>`
ships three starter projects baked into the binary; "Zero to deployed
CRUD in 15 minutes" tutorial walks scaffold → Postgres + migrations →
native build → Docker → k8s rollout.

**Editor**: LSP gains go-to-definition, rename, context-aware completion
(`catch (e: ?)` / `use ?` / default keywords + builtins + user fns).
VS Code Marketplace publish pipeline wired (Marketplace + OpenVSX,
GitHub Release artefact fallback when secrets are missing).

**Formatter**: `jwc fmt` finished via hybrid AST + line-based dispatch
(line-based when source contains comments, AST canonical output
otherwise, line-based fallback on parse error). CLI:
`jwc fmt [paths] [--check] [--stdout]`. Idempotency test walks every
`.jwc` under `examples/`, `templates/`, `tests/conformance/cases/`.

**Codemod scaffold**: `jwc upgrade [paths] [--dry-run]` lands the
deprecation migration runner. Registry is empty at v0.4.8; first
scheduled rule is `no-typecheck-removed` in v0.6.0
(per `DEPRECATION.md`).

**Autogen docs**: `src/bin/gen_builtins_doc.rs` walks `BUILTIN_DEFS`
into `docs/docs/reference/builtins.md` grouped by 15 categories.
`tests/builtins_doc_sync.rs` fails CI when the checked-in doc
diverges from the generator output.

Tests: 336 lib (+6), 8 jwc-runtime, 35 conformance, 3 native_parity,
21 imports, 1 fmt_idempotency, 1 builtins_doc_sync, 1 lsp_smoke (3
ignored), 1 chaos (ignored), 1 lib ignored. Builds clean default +
`--features otlp`.

Phase 8 [1.0-blocker] developer experience closed. Long-form docs
site finalization + registry stable-contract write-up remain as
follow-up content work.

## [0.4.7] — Sprint 1-5 chala ishlar yopildi: Phase 2/6/7 close-outs

Closing every remaining partial-state item from Phases 2, 6, and 7 so
the 1.0 ship gate has nothing dangling above the line. v0.4.7 ships:

**Phase 2 #11 — unwrap budget audit**

The plan listed ~340 `.unwrap()` calls to convert; the actual audit found
the inflation came from counting `tests.rs` modules + double-counting
mod.rs+tests.rs. After this commit there is exactly **one** production
`.unwrap()` in `src/`, converted to `.expect("INVARIANT: ...")` with a
precise reason.

- `src/runner/types.rs:168` — `.unwrap()` → `.expect("INVARIANT: ...")`.
- `Cargo.toml` `[lints.clippy]` comment block rewritten: the right flip
  is per-module `#![cfg_attr(not(test), warn(clippy::unwrap_used))]`,
  not a global `warn`. Both lints stay `allow` with a documented
  TODO[unwrap-budget] for the per-module pass.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` extended: three categories (A INVARIANT / B Result?
  / C Mutex), marker conventions, lint roadmap.

**Phase 6 — Security program close-out**

A. cargo audit blocking flip:

- Bumped `tokio-postgres = "0.7.18"` (from 0.7.16) — closes
  RUSTSEC-2026-0178 / -0179 / -0180.
- `.github/workflows/security.yml` confirmed blocking (no
  continue-on-error). Ignore list reviewed; remaining 8 IDs justified.
- `SECURITY.md` gains "Dependency hygiene" section pointing at the new
  threat-model doc.

B. Threat-model pass — `docs/spec/threat-model.md` (new):

- **Path traversal in `{param}` capture** — `match_route_pattern`
  rejects `..`, `.`, `/`, `\`, NUL via new `is_traversal_segment`
  helper. +4 regression tests.
- **Header injection** — interpreter path was already safe via
  `axum::HeaderValue::parse()`. Native AOT now also rejects
  `\r`/`\n`/NUL in header values (was only checking names).
- **SSRF allowlist** — new `JWC_HTTP_ALLOWLIST` env var (CSV hosts);
  empty/unset = no restriction (backwards compat). Helper
  `check_url_allowlisted` wired into `http_get`/`http_post`/`fetch_json`
  in the interpreter AND `jwc_check_url_allowlisted` in native AOT.
  Registered in `src/config.rs::REGISTRY`. +3 tests.
- **JWT `exp` enforcement** — `jwt::verify_hs256` now checks `exp`
  after signature verify. Absent → accept (don't break old tokens);
  past → reject with `"token expired"`. Closes the Sprint 3A
  `JwtError.Expired` deferral; classifier branch added; the kind sits
  in `JWC_ERROR_KINDS`. +3 tests.
- **SQL interpolation audit** — clean: every `format!`-built SQL site
  uses compiler-resolved table/column names; user values flow through
  `$N` placeholders + `boxed_params`. Documented with file:line
  citations.

C. Secrets redaction:

- `src/engine.rs::scrub_database_url` masks `://user:password@` →
  `://user:***@`; called wherever connection-string strings flow into
  error context. +4 tests.
- `src/error_report.rs::scrub_secrets` is the last-pass scrubber for
  the CLI error printer + runtime error logs. Strips
  `scheme://user:password@` AND `password=...` (stops at
  `&`/whitespace/quote). Wired into `print_cli_error`,
  `log_runtime_error_text`, `log_runtime_error_json`, `to_single_line`.
  +3 tests including `database_url_with_password_redacted_in_connection_error`
  and `smtp_password_not_leaked_in_error_chain`.

**Phase 7 — Performance with receipts (partial)**

A. Bench DB tier added to `bench` repo (`_my/jwc-app`):

- `entity World of BenchDb` (`@id int`, `randomNumber int`).
- Migration `1781373067_init-bench.{up,down}.sql` — `world` table
  + 10,000-row seed via `generate_series` with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
  (idempotent).
- Three new TechEmpower-shape routes:
  * `GET /db` — single random SELECT.
  * `GET /queries?queries=N` — N selects, N clamped 1..500.
  * `GET /updates?queries=N` — N update+select pairs.
- `bench/.dist/bench.sh` + `bench.ps1` extended with the three new
  endpoints at `c=64 d=15s`; URL builder appends `?queries=20`.
- `bench/.dist/setup-linux.sh` gains an idempotent `psql` seed block
  guarded by `JWC_BENCH_SKIP_DB` + `DATABASE_URL` presence.

B. README "Performance" section (`jwc-lang/README.md`):

Top-of-file 3-bullet headline + bench-repo link. The strongest
positioning asset the project has is now visible above the fold.

C. AOT scope contract (`docs/spec/aot-scope.md` + native_build header):

Explicitly scopes 1.0 native AOT as the **stateless route tier**.
Documents: what works end-to-end on `--native` (stateless routes,
V::Record, response helpers, simple select/update/insert, cache,
sleep_ms, http_get, JWT, hashing), what panics in the native build
(`savepoint`, the Postgres queue worker loop), what falls back to
`jwc run` (long-running queue workers, mid-tx savepoints, OTLP traces).
`src/native_build.rs:30` header comment updated to point at the new doc.

**Error kinds catalog:**

- `JwtError.Expired` lands (closes Sprint 3A deferral).

**Env vars added:**

- `JWC_HTTP_ALLOWLIST` (CSV hosts; empty = no restriction).

Tests: 324 lib (was 306, +18 across security + redaction + path
traversal + SSRF + JWT exp), 8 jwc-runtime, 35 conformance,
3 native_parity, 21 imports, 1 chaos (ignored), 1 lib ignored.
Builds clean default + `--features otlp`.

Sprint 1-5 + every chala ish closed. Phase 6 done; Phase 7 partially
(bench DB tier + scope docs + README — Linux session execution +
GitHub Actions regression gate + 72h soak run remain as ops-side
work).

## [0.4.6] — Sprints 2–5: code health + Phase 3/4/5 [1.0-blocker] close-outs

The big Sprint 1-5 wrap. v0.4.5 shipped the Phase 1 unified value model;
v0.4.6 closes every remaining [1.0-blocker] across Phases 2, 3, 4, and 5
of `PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md`.

**Sprint 2 — code health & diagnostics**

- `src/runner/mod.rs` (5,647 lines) decomposed into 9 sub-modules:
  `dispatch.rs`, `eval.rs`, `exec.rs`, `sql.rs`, `types.rs`, `util.rs`,
  `validation.rs`, plus the pre-existing `builtins.rs` and a `tests.rs`
  harness. Every production sub-file under 1,200 lines; `mod.rs` 787.
- `src/parser.rs` (5,197 lines) decomposed into 7 sub-modules:
  `decl.rs`, `expr.rs`, `stmt.rs`, `validate.rs`, `validate_walk.rs`,
  plus a `tests.rs` harness. All under 1,200 lines.
- `fuzz/` standalone crate with `lex` + `parse` libFuzzer targets +
  `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml` nightly 8h-per-target CI.

**Sprint 3 — typed catch + dotted subtypes + gradual type checker**

- `JWC_ERROR_KINDS` grows from 5 to 18 entries with hierarchical
  dot-paths (DbError.UniqueViolation, HttpError.NotFound, etc.).
- Classifier downcasts `tokio_postgres::Error` (SQLSTATE matrix) and
  `reqwest::Error` (HTTP status family). Parent matches all
  children; "Error" still catches everything.
- Parser accepts `catch (e: A.B.C)` dotted form. Validator does
  prefix lookup (`closest_known_kind` hint on unknown root).
- **Gradual static type checker (`src/typecheck.rs`)**:
  E018 return type, E019 call-site arity, E020 arg type. Wired
  via `project::load_project_from_root_with` so every loader path
  runs it. `--no-typecheck` escape hatch on `jwc check / run / build`.
- `docs/spec/semantics.md` covers integer overflow, float format,
  UTF-8 strings, `==` cross-type rules.

**Sprint 3 #16 — AOT visibility re-check**

- New `parser::validate::check_visibility` walks every call site in
  functions / routes / middlewares / errorHandler. Emits E021 with a
  did-you-mean hint when a private function is referenced across
  namespaces.
- `src/native_build.rs` codegen header updated: "NOT re-checked here"
  → precise reference to the validator section + `docs/spec/visibility.md`.

**Sprint 4 — data layer hardening**

- **Migration safety**: `_jwc_migrations` gains a `checksum text`
  column (idempotent ALTER). `migrate up` recomputes the SHA-256 of
  every already-applied `.up.sql` and refuses to run on a mismatch.
  Each migration is wrapped in `BEGIN; ... COMMIT;` UNLESS the file
  opens with `BEGIN` itself (CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY etc.).
  `jwc migrate status` prints the applied / pending / sha-mismatch /
  orphan matrix; `--dry-run` on `up` and `down`.
- **Savepoints**: new `savepoint <name> { ... }` syntax inside
  `transaction { }`. Engine helper issues `SAVEPOINT/RELEASE/
  ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`. Naked `transaction { transaction {} }` is
  rejected with **E016**; savepoint outside transaction with **E017**.
- **`json()` validates strings, `json_unchecked()` escape hatch**.
  Interpreter: unconditional validation. Native AOT:
  `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` validation. The old footgun (passing
  malformed JSON as a 200 body) is closed by default.
- **Pool resilience**: retry-with-backoff on transient errors
  (SQLSTATE 08* / 40001, `tokio_postgres::Error::is_closed()`,
  `PoolError::Backend`/`Timeout`). Skipped inside `transaction {}`
  to avoid silent re-execution. `JWC_DB_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (3) +
  `JWC_DB_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS` (100, exponential). New
  `engine::ping()` wired into `/readyz`. Four `jwc_db_pool_*` gauges
  added to `/metrics`. Chaos test recipe at
  `tests/integration_chaos.rs` (ignored; documents the testcontainers
  setup).

**Sprint 5 — Phase 5 close-out**

- **`src/config.rs`**: 29-entry registry of every JWC_* env var.
  Boot-time `validate_or_bail()` + rendered ASCII config table
  (gated by `JWC_PRINT_CONFIG`, default on). Redaction of
  PASSWORD / SECRET / TOKEN / KEY / JWT / DATABASE_URL in
  the rendered output.
- **OTLP optional tracing** (`src/observability/otlp.rs`) behind
  Cargo feature `otlp`. `JWC_OTLP_ENDPOINT` runtime gate;
  `JWC_SERVICE_NAME` resource attribute. W3C
  `TraceContextPropagator` global. `OtlpGuard` flushes the batch
  span processor on `Drop`.
- **Postgres-backed persistent job queue**: pluggable `JobDriver`
  trait + `enum Driver { InMemory, Postgres }` behind a `OnceLock`.
  In-memory stays the default. `JWC_QUEUE_DRIVER=postgres` switches
  to the durable driver — own multi-thread runtime + mpsc bridge to
  avoid nested-runtime panics. DDL: `_jwc_jobs` + dispatch index +
  `_jwc_jobs_dlq`. Dequeue uses `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
  with a 30-second lease; `nack` moves to DLQ when
  `attempts >= max_attempts`.
- **72h soak harness** (`soak/`): `run-soak.sh` cycle driver,
  `analyze.py` PASS/FAIL gate (RSS drift ≤ 10%, lost responses == 0),
  `chaos-script.sh` SIGTERM sidecar, `.github/workflows/soak.yml`
  manual-dispatch self-hosted job.

**Error codes added (catalog @ `src/error_codes.rs`):**

- E016 nested transaction; E017 savepoint outside transaction
- E018 return type mismatch; E019 arity mismatch; E020 arg type
- E021 private function called across namespace

**Env vars added:**

- Phase 3: (none — error code only)
- Phase 4: `JWC_DB_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `JWC_DB_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS`
- Phase 5: `JWC_PRINT_CONFIG`, `JWC_OTLP_ENDPOINT`,
  `JWC_SERVICE_NAME`, `JWC_QUEUE_DRIVER`

**CLI additions:**

- `jwc check --no-typecheck`, `jwc run --no-typecheck`,
  `jwc build --no-typecheck`
- `jwc migrate up --dry-run`, `jwc migrate down --dry-run`
- `jwc migrate status`
- `jwc --version` long form now includes target / profile / rustc /
  git hash (carried over from v0.4.4)

**New Cargo feature:** `otlp` (gated opentelemetry / tracing /
tracing-opentelemetry deps).

Tests: 306 lib (was 251 at sprint 1, +55), 8 jwc-runtime,
35 conformance (was 25), 3 native_parity (was 1), 21 imports
(was 17, +4 visibility), 1 chaos (ignored), 1 lib ignored
(Postgres-driver smoke). All green.

Sprint 1–5 [1.0-blocker] punch list closed. Phase 6 (security
program close-out) and Phase 7+ (perf-with-receipts, DX, release
engineering) remain.

## [0.4.5] — Phase 1 unified value model: Value::Record everywhere

Performance + architectural release. Closes the Phase 1 [1.0-blocker]
Sprint 1 punch-list from `PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md`: the
interpreter and AOT both flow object-shaped values through a single
typed-shape Record carrier, shape names are deduplicated across rows,
and the value model now lives in a sibling `jwc-runtime` crate so a
future interpreter ⇄ AOT unification has somewhere to land.

Highlights:

- **`Value::Record { field_names: Arc<Vec<Arc<str>>>, values: Arc<Vec<Value>> }`**
  — the interpreter's typed-shape object variant. Object literals,
  `select` rows, `json_parse(s)` of any object, and `set_json_field`
  on a known shape all materialise as Record. Field access is O(N)
  linear scan over the shared `field_names` Arc — no JSON parse
  round-trip on `obj.field`, no per-row Vec<String> allocation. The
  `Value::Str(json_string)` fallback stays for computed-key literals
  + non-JSON `json_parse` payloads.

- **DB rows go straight to Record.** `Expr::DbSelect` eagerly parses
  the engine's JSON result via the new `materialize_select_result`
  helper: one `field_names` Arc per query, one `Vec<Value>` per row,
  N rows share the schema layout via Arc refcount. The headline
  /json-large win the production-readiness plan targets.

- **AOT mirror.** `src/native_prelude.rs.in` gains a `V::Record`
  variant with the same shape (`field_names: Arc<Vec<JwcStr>>`,
  `values: Arc<Vec<V>>`). `native_build.rs` interns each
  declaration-order key list into `CodegenCtx.shapes` and emits one
  `fn __jwc_shape_N() -> &'static Arc<Vec<JwcStr>>` getter (wrapping
  a `std::sync::OnceLock`) per distinct shape. Object literals
  become `v_record(Arc::clone(__jwc_shape_N()), vec![...])` — no
  per-construction `JwcObj::default()` + 3-7 FxHashMap inserts.

- **`crates/jwc-runtime/` sibling crate.** Extracted `Value`,
  `format_float`, `value_to_json`, `value_to_json_smart`,
  `json_to_value`, `materialize_select_result`, and the
  matching unit tests into `crates/jwc-runtime/src/lib.rs`. The
  main crate keeps a `pub use jwc_runtime::{...}` re-export so
  call sites compile unchanged. Path dep, no `[workspace]` mode
  (kept simple deliberately — the AOT-uses-runtime-as-crate
  follow-up is a separate sprint).

- **Per-request micro-fixes** (carried over from v0.4.4 close):
  `Request.response_status` is now `AtomicU16` instead of
  `Mutex<Option<u16>>`; `jwc_set_response_status()` is only
  emitted on routes whose middleware chain has at least one
  `after { ... }` block (stateless routes emit zero Phase-5
  instrumentation now).

Bench against the http-framework-benchmark suite on the same
machine (bombardier 15s @ warmup 3s):

  /json-large:  14,643 -> 15,378  (+5.0%, the targeted V::Record win)
  /async-delay: 31,108 -> 33,014  (+6.1%, reduced alloc pressure)
  /ping:        129,227 -> 129,382 (noise)
  /json-small:  125,918 -> 128,017 (+1.7%)
  /cpu:         127 -> 120        (noise on the SHA-256 bound path)

jwc-app now ~6% clear of go-fiber on /json-large (15,378 vs 14,516).
Other stacks unchanged from the v0.4.0 cross-stack snapshot.

Tests: 251 lib (8 moved out to the sub-crate), 8 jwc-runtime,
30 conformance (5 new Record cases), 3 native_parity (2 new V::Record
+ shape-dedup codegen cases). All green.

Sprint 1 of the production-readiness plan closed. Sprint 2
(decompose `runner/mod.rs` + `parser.rs`, unwrap budget walk,
cargo-fuzz CI) is next.

## [0.4.4] — Phase 5 close-out + observability bundle

Second large bundle on top of v0.4.3. Folds 30+ commits shipped in
this session that close the rest of the Phase 5 server-reliability
gate, finish the Phase 1 write-side monomorphization wiring through
the AOT codegen, and add the observability surface (Prometheus
`/metrics`, JSON access logs, `request_id` + W3C `traceparent`
propagation, response-phase `after { ... }` middleware in interpreter
*and* native).

Highlights:

- **Phase 5** — built-in `/healthz` + `/readyz` + `/metrics`,
  SIGTERM handler, `JWC_MAX_BODY_BYTES`, `JWC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`
  watchdog with 504 envelope, `JWC_LOG_FORMAT=json` structured
  logs, `JWC_TRUSTED_PROXIES`-aware `client_ip()`, `request_id()`
  + `x-request-id` propagation, W3C `traceparent` reuse-as-id +
  `traceparent`/`tracestate` echo on response, queue drain on
  shutdown, response-phase `after { ... }` middleware (interpreter
  + native AOT), `response_status()` / `response_duration_ms()` /
  `request_id()` builtins.
- **Phase 1** — `V::RawJson` write-side fragment carrier;
  `emit_db_select` simple-select path now produces
  `JwcEnt_<Name>::jwc_from_row(r)` → `jwc_write_json(&mut buf)` →
  `V::RawJson(buf.into())`, fully skipping `V::Object` on both the
  read and the write side.
- **Phase 2** — spanned validator errors with per-file `<label>:line:col`
  + rustc snippet (single + multi-file), lint enforcement in
  `jwc build` / `jwc test`, `--deny-warnings` CI gate, did-you-mean
  hints on every `Unknown column` site, did-you-mean on native
  unknown-function errors, E011 / E012 / E013 / E014 / E015 codes.
- **Phase 4** — atomic `update CTX.Table set col = expr where ...`
  closes the lost-update race on the jwc-shortener `hits` counter.
- **Phase 3** — `substring(s, start, len)` + `take(s, n)` builtins.

CLI / DX: `jwc --version` long form prints target + profile + rustc +
git short hash. Conformance suite grew from 16 → 25 cases, each
running in an isolated 8 MiB-stack thread with its own tokio
current_thread runtime so `case_functions`-style recursive fixtures
don't flap under parallel `#[tokio::test]` pressure.

Docs: deployment env-vars reference page, k8s probes / scrape /
trusted-proxy snippet, security supply-chain section, monomorphization
wins note on the native-build page, response-phase `after { ... }`
section on the README + middleware doc, seven-step "shipping a new
builtin" recipe in CONTRIBUTING.md.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **W3C `traceparent` propagation.** When an upstream service sends
  a well-formed `traceparent: 00-<32-hex>-<16-hex>-<flags>` header,
  the server reuses the trace-id as `request_id()` instead of
  generating a local one. Distributed tracing across hops just
  works: a Tempo / Jaeger / Honeycomb query for the trace-id
  surfaces every JWC service it passed through. Malformed
  traceparents fall back to the local counter id (never refuse a
  request over a broken upstream header).
- **Native AOT codegen for response-phase `after { ... }` blocks.**
  Each middleware with an after-body now emits a separate
  `mw_<name>_after()` fn alongside `mw_<name>()`; the route
  dispatcher calls them in reverse middleware order after the
  handler. Interpreter shipped in v0.4.3; this slice closes the
  follow-up.
- **Native AOT `response_status()` is fully wired.** Previously a
  V::Null stub. The `Request` task-local now carries a
  `Mutex<Option<u16>>` slot that the route dispatcher populates
  between handler return and after-chain dispatch, so
  `response_status()` inside `after { ... }` blocks reads the wire
  status. Tied to a new `after_block_sees_response_status` parity
  case.
- **`jwc --version` is operator-friendly.** The long flag now also
  prints the cargo target triple, build profile, git short commit,
  and rustc version line. Short `-V` keeps emitting just `jwc 0.4.3`
  for script-friendly probes.
- **Three new diagnostic codes:** E013 (bulk `delete from CTX.Table`
  without `where`), E014 (route handler references undefined fn),
  E015 (duplicate function name in the project namespace).
- **Two new conformance cases:** `case_array_helpers` pins `range`
  edge semantics + `join` separator corners; `case_json_helpers`
  pins `json_stringify` -> `json_parse` round-trip + mixed-type
  array serialization. Conformance suite is now 25 cases.

### Changed
- **Docs:** `docs/spec/semantics.md` now pins after-block dispatch
  order (reverse), error isolation, and the timeout-skip rule.
  `docs/spec/builtins.md` pins the hash builtin family
  (sha256/sha1/md5/hmac_sha256) with output length, casing,
  null-prop, and the "not for passwords" warning.
  `docs/docs/backend/middleware.md` documents `after { ... }` with
  a runnable Telemetry example.
  `docs/docs/backend/queue.md` adds a backoff schedule table.
  `docs/docs/data/select.md` cross-links to atomic `update ... set`.
  `docs/docs/deployment/native-build.md` explains the
  monomorphization wins.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md:** a seven-step recipe for shipping a new
  builtin (interpreter, validator, native codegen, spec, user docs,
  conformance, changelog) so the v1.0 freeze can't catch a builtin
  with no test or no spec entry.

### Tests
- Lib unit tests: 243 -> 249 (six new server.rs tests covering the
  access-line JSON envelope shape, path escaping rules, text-form
  layout, and three new traceparent boundary cases).
- Conformance: 23 -> 25.

## [0.4.3] — Phase 1/2/4/5 1.0-blockers, dogfooding bundle

Twenty-six commits land together as a single release because each is
incremental and the shipping cadence in this session was per-commit
green builds. The bundle closes six 1.0-blockers across four phases:

- Phase 1 — Struct monomorphization (read + write), `V::RawJson`
  fragment carrier, `emit_db_select` now skips `V::Object` on simple
  selects. /json-large gap closed at the codegen level.
- Phase 2 — Spanned validator errors (single + multi-file),
  rustc-style snippets, lint enforcement in `jwc build` / `jwc test`,
  `--deny-warnings` CI gate, unwrap-budget policy + `[lints.clippy]`
  slot.
- Phase 4 — Atomic `update CTX.Table set col = expr where ...`
  closes the lost-update race observed live on jwc-shortener's
  hits counter.
- Phase 5 — SIGTERM handler, request body cap, /healthz + /readyz +
  /metrics built-in endpoints, client_ip() with JWC_TRUSTED_PROXIES,
  request_id() + x-request-id, JWC_LOG_FORMAT=json, queue drain on
  shutdown, response-phase `after { ... }` middleware.
- Phase 3 — `substring(s, start, len)` + `take(s, n)` builtins close
  the dogfooded `split(s, "")` workaround.

Conformance suite grew from 16 → 21 cases. Each runs in an
8 MiB-stack thread so `case_functions` and friends don't flap under
parallel `#[tokio::test]` pressure.

### Added
- **Graceful shutdown drains the background queue.** The kubelet
  TERM path used to log `draining N inflight requests` and return
  immediately. Any pending job (welcome email, sync ping) was lost on
  exit. The shutdown signal now also polls `queue::pending_count()`
  in a `spawn_blocking` task until it hits zero or `JWC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`
  fires — workers stay alive in the meantime so they keep draining.
  A leftover count is logged so operators can spot a queue that
  never drains cleanly.
- **`client_ip()` honours `JWC_TRUSTED_PROXIES`.** Walks the
  `JWC_REAL_IP_HEADER` chain RIGHT to LEFT, peeling off any entries
  whose prefix matches the comma-separated `JWC_TRUSTED_PROXIES`
  list, and returns the first untrusted entry — the original client.
  Empty / unset trust list means "trust no proxy in the chain" and
  the rightmost entry wins. Mirrors nginx + Go's `net/http`
  semantics. **Behaviour change** from the prior slice (which always
  returned the leftmost entry — spoofable when the LB doesn't
  overwrite the slot); set `JWC_TRUSTED_PROXIES` to your LB / k8s
  ingress prefix (e.g. `10.,127.0.0.1,::1`) to opt back into
  client-IP semantics. Native AOT + interpreter both updated.
- **`/metrics` exports queue depth + DLQ size.** Two more
  Prometheus gauges (`jwc_queue_pending`, `jwc_queue_dlq`) join the
  HTTP counters / gauges so operators can chart a backlog before it
  becomes an SLO breach.
- **Response-phase middleware: `middleware Name { … } after { … }`.**
  Closes the biggest jwc-shortener dogfooding gap: pre-handler
  middleware couldn't read the response, so `latency_ms` and `status`
  in their request-log table were hardcoded to 0 / 200. The optional
  `after { ... }` block now runs after the route handler, in reverse
  middleware order (mirroring Express / koa / ring), with two new
  builtins exposed:
    - `response_status()` — HTTP status the handler produced.
    - `response_duration_ms()` — ms since dispatch began.
  Errors thrown inside an `after` block are logged but don't override
  the response — by the time it runs the response has already been
  committed. Native AOT covers the parser and the dispatch side via
  the interpreter; native-codegen for `after` bodies is the follow-up.
- **Phase 1.6 — write-side monomorphization through `V::RawJson`.**
  The native runtime gains a new V variant: `V::RawJson(JwcStr)` carries
  an opaque, already-encoded JSON fragment. `jwc_write_json` writes
  the bytes verbatim; every other match arm (truthy, Display)
  treats it like a `V::Str`. `emit_db_select` for simple entity
  selects now generates `JwcEnt_<Name>::jwc_from_row(r)` →
  `jwc_write_json(&mut buf)` → `V::RawJson(buf.into())` per row,
  wrapped in a `V::Array`. The dynamic `V::Object` / FxHashMap
  allocation is GONE from the hot path — neither the read nor the
  write side touches it. This is the slice
  PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md called out as the Phase 1 1.0-blocker
  ("close the /json-large axum gap"); the benchmark run lands in the
  follow-up commit alongside the bench.sh harness update.
- **`request_id()` builtin + `x-request-id` response header.** The
  server stamps a unique id on every HTTP request (16 hex chars,
  `<wall_secs><counter>`), threads it into the runtime so middleware
  / handler / `errorHandler` all read the same value via
  `request_id()`, includes it on every response as `x-request-id`,
  and adds it to both text and JSON access log shapes (text: `(rid=…)`
  suffix; JSON: top-level `"request_id"` field). The plain
  `run_request_with_headers` entry point keeps its old shape — the
  new `run_request_with_headers_and_id(...)` is what the server uses;
  tests that don't stamp see `request_id()` as `null`.
- **Built-in `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus text format.** The
  bundled launcher's existing `ServerMetrics` (request counts,
  in-flight gauge, running mean / peak latency) now scrapes natively
  via `/metrics`. Each metric carries `# HELP` and `# TYPE` so
  Grafana's metric explorer surfaces a description and the
  aggregator picks the right query semantics (counter vs gauge).
  Latency is exposed as seconds (Prometheus convention) — a running
  mean and a peak; bucketed histograms land alongside the tracing
  / OTel work. User precedence applies: `route GET "metrics"` in
  the program takes the slot. Closes the Phase 5 dogfooding gap
  where every project had to roll its own counters / scrape route.
- **`JWC_LOG_FORMAT=json` for structured logs.** When set, both the
  per-request access line (`jwc serve --request-logging`) and the
  runtime error log (caught by `error_report::log_runtime_error`)
  switch from the legacy `[JWC] …` / `[JWC-ERROR] …` text shape to
  newline-delimited JSON: `{"level":"info","kind":"access","method":...,
  "path":...,"status":...,"latency_us":...}` and
  `{"level":"error","context":...,"message":...,"causes":[...]}`.
  k8s log aggregators (Loki, Datadog, CloudWatch) parse this natively
  — no regex extraction, level field is first-class, the anyhow error
  chain stays addressable per index. Default stays text so existing
  scrapers and interactive `jwc run` output don't break.
- **`client_ip()` builtin with proxy-header override.** Reads
  `JWC_REAL_IP_HEADER` (default `x-forwarded-for`) from request
  headers and returns the FIRST entry of the comma-separated chain —
  the original client, not the closest proxy. Returns `null` when the
  header is absent. Closes the jwc-shortener dogfooding gap where
  rate-limit code had to hand-roll `header("x-forwarded-for")` per
  app and got Cloudflare's `cf-connecting-ip` precedence wrong;
  flipping the builtin to a Cloudflare deploy is now an env-var
  change (`JWC_REAL_IP_HEADER=cf-connecting-ip`). Native AOT and
  interpreter both ship the builtin; spec entry follows.
- **Built-in `/healthz` + `/readyz` endpoints with DB probe.** The
  bundled launcher's server now registers both routes by default:
  `/healthz` is the liveness probe (always 200 — if axum can answer,
  the process is alive); `/readyz` round-trips a `SELECT 1` against
  the configured pool and returns 503 with a short `{"db":"..."}`
  body if the DB is unreachable. The user can ship their own handler
  for either path — `route GET "healthz"` registered in the program
  takes precedence and the built-in yields. Closes the dogfooding
  gap where jwc-shortener's hand-rolled `/healthz` had no DB check,
  so kubelet probes stayed green through a database outage. No
  `DATABASE_URL` configured means `/readyz` falls back to liveness-only.
- **String builtins `substring(s, start, len)` + `take(s, n)`** — char-based
  slicing that closes the gap surfaced by jwc-shortener (where the only
  workaround was a `split(s, "")` for-loop). UTF-8 safe, out-of-range
  inputs clamp to `""`, null threads through. Native AOT covered; spec
  entry pinned in `docs/spec/builtins.md`. Both names defer to a
  user-declared function of the same name when one exists.
- **`jwc build --deny-warnings` / `jwc test --deny-warnings`** — promotes
  lint warnings to errors for CI gates.
- **Atomic `update CTX.Table set col = expr where ...`** — partial-row
  update that compiles to a single SQL `UPDATE` (no preceding read).
  Closes the lost-update race the whole-row form `update var in CTX.Table`
  has under concurrency — observed live on jwc-shortener's `hits`
  counter. Column refs (`hits`) and column arithmetic (`hits + 1`) stay
  inline in the SQL so the increment is genuinely atomic; everything
  else is evaluated host-side once and bound as `$N`. Both interpreter
  and native AOT codegen. `where` clause required; column validation
  happens at compile time.
- **Spanned validator errors** — top-level decls (DbContext, Model,
  Route, Function, Middleware, Const) now carry a byte `offset` of their
  opening keyword, and `Program` carries the original source string.
  Validator errors render as `<msg> at line X, col Y` + rustc-style
  snippet for thirteen of the most-hit sites (duplicate name/route,
  unsupported method, missing handler, …). Multi-file projects fall
  back to the bare-message shape — per-file source tracking is next.
- **`Token::end_offset`** + **`SourceMap::snippet(offset)`** — building
  blocks for span-carrying AST nodes. Parser errors already use this
  to render an in-source caret under the failing token.
- **Per-file source tracking in validator diagnostics.** `Program` now
  carries a `Vec<SourceFile>` (label + text) instead of a single
  source string, and every top-level decl records the `file_idx` of
  the file it came from. Multi-file projects now render validator
  errors as `at <relative-path>:<line>:<col>` + snippet — the previous
  slice cleared `program.source` on merge, so multi-file projects
  fell back to the bare message shape. `parse_program(src)` keeps the
  short single-file shape; `parse_program_with_label(src, label)` is
  the new entry point the project loader uses to flow file paths in.
  Single-file output is byte-identical so the LSP regex resolves.
  Ctrl+C path stays — but kubelet's rolling-deploy TERM signal no
  longer waits for the `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` ceiling to
  SIGKILL the process. The shutdown log line names which signal
  fired (`SIGINT` vs `SIGTERM`) so operators can distinguish a
  k8s deploy from an interactive Ctrl+C. Windows behaviour is
  unchanged.
- **Request body size cap.** New `JWC_MAX_BODY_BYTES` env var (default
  2 MiB) hard-caps inbound request bodies via axum's `DefaultBodyLimit`.
  Setting the var to `0` disables the cap for projects that already
  enforce a size at the proxy (nginx, Cloudflare). Without this a
  single client streaming an unbounded body could OOM the worker —
  exactly the kind of footgun the Phase 5 plan flags as a 1.0-blocker.
- **Phase 1 struct monomorphization — codegen foundation.** Every
  `entity` declared in a project now produces a concrete Rust struct
  (`JwcEnt_<Name>`) in the emitted source, alongside a `jwc_to_v`
  serializer that lifts it into the dynamic `V` enum the rest of the
  runtime speaks. Field types map column-for-column (Smallint → i16,
  Int → i32, Bigint → i64, Float → f64, Bool → bool, Timestamp/Str →
  String); nullable columns wrap in `Option<T>`. The struct is not
  yet wired onto the hot path — the next slice replaces `V::Object`
  on `select` results with these structs so JSON serialisation skips
  the FxHashMap that `/json-large` round-trips through (closes the
  axum gap documented in PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md Phase 1).
- **Phase 1.5c — `emit_db_select` wired to the typed read path.**
  "Simple" entity selects (no projection, no `with` relations) now
  generate `jwc_db_query_rows(sql, params)` →
  `JwcEnt_<Name>::jwc_from_row(row)` → `jwc_to_v()` instead of the
  dynamic `jwc_row_to_v` FxHashMap roundtrip. The Vec<V> shape
  downstream is identical, so JSON serialisation and route returns
  stay the same — this slice closes the read-side allocation, the
  write-side switchover (skip V::Object entirely) is the next slice.
  Complex paths (projection / eager-load) keep the dynamic codepath
  because the monomorphized struct has a fixed shape that doesn't
  match a partial projection.
- **Phase 1.5b — `jwc_db_query_rows` raw-row helper on the DB
  prelude.** Returns `Vec<tokio_postgres::Row>` so generated code can
  feed each row straight into a monomorphized `JwcEnt_<Name>` via
  the struct's `jwc_from_row` ctor without going through the dynamic
  `V::Object` detour. `jwc_db_query` keeps its `Vec<V>` signature for
  callers that still want the FxHashMap shape — it's a one-line
  wrapper now. Per-callsite switchover is the next slice.
- **Phase 1.5 — typed row reader + direct JSON writer on every
  monomorphized struct.** `JwcEnt_<Name>` now ships with
  `jwc_from_row(row: &tokio_postgres::Row) -> Self` (reads columns by
  declared-order index, skipping the per-row column-name lookup the
  dynamic `jwc_row_to_v` does) and `jwc_write_json(&self, out: &mut
  String)` (appends `{"col":value, ...}` straight into a String — no
  `V::Object` allocation, no `serde_json::Value` round-trip, no
  FxHashMap on the hot path). Methods are emitted on every entity
  unconditionally and marked `#[allow(dead_code)]`; the next slice
  rewires `emit_db_select` to use them and closes the `/json-large`
  RPS gap.

### Changed
- **`jwc build` and `jwc test` now run the lint pass by default** and
  surface warnings on stderr before continuing. Closes the dogfooding gap
  where jwc-shortener shipped with a declared-but-unused `RateLimit`
  middleware and nothing in the build path said a word — the warning
  existed, but only `jwc lint` (opt-in) ran it. Warnings stay advisory
  unless `--deny-warnings` is set.

## [0.4.2] — Spec scaffold, SemVer policy, release hardening

Docs + supply-chain release. No language-level behaviour change; user
`.jwc` source compiles without modification. Closes the Phase 0 and the
remaining Phase 6 quick-wins from `PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md`.

### Added
- **`docs/spec/`** — language specification scaffold. `grammar.ebnf`
  covers the top-level grammar (declarations, statements, expressions,
  routes, SQL `select`) with `TODO` markers on incomplete productions;
  `semantics.md` pins evaluation order, scope, async suspension,
  coercion, integer/float behaviour, DB and HTTP semantics, and an
  explicit "what is NOT specified yet" section; `builtins.md` defines
  the contract template (Signature / Errors / Notes / Tests) and lands
  the first batch of entries (length, replace, split, hashes, time,
  body / response / serve).
- **`SEMVER.md`** — what counts as a breaking change, what does not,
  release cadence target, pre-release suffix contract, yank policy.
- **`DEPRECATION.md`** — minimum warning window (pre-1.0 ≥ 1 minor,
  post-1.0 full minor cycle), what can/cannot be deprecated, lifecycle,
  authoring checklist (W#### code + CHANGELOG + test + spec update +
  `jwc upgrade` rule).
- **`SECURITY.md`** — private vulnerability disclosure via GitHub
  Security Advisories, 72h ack / 14d high-severity fix SLA, explicit
  in-scope/out-of-scope list, hardening notes for users.
- **`.github/dependabot.yml`** — weekly updates for cargo, GitHub
  Actions, and both npm trees (`docs/`, `vscode-extension/`), with
  minor/patch grouped.
- **README — Performance section** linking the
  [http-framework-benchmark](https://github.com/just-web-code/http-framework-benchmark)
  repo with the v0.4.x headline numbers.

### Changed
- **Release artifacts now carry `.sha256` checksums.**
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs `sha256sum` (Linux) and
  `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256` (Windows) over each tarball/zip and
  attaches the sidecar `.sha256` to both the CI artifact and the GitHub
  Release.
- **`install.sh` / `install.ps1`** now download the `.sha256` next to
  the archive and verify it before extracting. Releases without a
  checksum (older than 0.4.2) warn and continue, so old tags remain
  installable.

### Deprecated
- None.

### Removed
- None.

### Internal
- Phase 0 conformance suite (16 cases across both interpreter and
  native AOT) shipped in `13a3cad` is now reachable from the spec docs;
  each spec entry references its conformance case.
- `PRODUCTION_READINESS_PLAN.md` Phase 0 + Phase 6 status updated to
  reflect landed vs remaining items.

## [0.4.1] — Native AOT Phase A perf

Performance-only release. No public API changes; user `.jwc` source compiles
without modification. Phase A of `PERF_PLAN.md` — closes a large chunk of the
gap to rust-axum reported in v0.4.0.

### Changed
- **`V::Object` payload** now uses `FxHashMap<String, V>` instead of
  `BTreeMap` — O(1) lookup, ~3× faster hashing on short keys. `jwc_write_json`
  sorts keys at serialisation time so JSON output stays byte-for-byte
  deterministic, and `raw_sql` keeps its alphabetic first-column semantics.
- **`V::Array` / `V::Object` payloads** are now `Arc<Vec<V>>` / `Arc<JwcObj>`.
  `Clone V` becomes a refcount bump instead of a deep copy of the whole
  subtree; mutating sites use `Arc::make_mut` (copy-on-write), consuming sites
  use `Arc::unwrap_or_clone`. `Arc` (not `Rc`) because axum tasks are `Send`.
- **`V::Str` payload** is `Cow<'static, str>`. Source literals codegen to
  `Cow::Borrowed(&'static str)` — zero per-request allocation; dynamic strings
  continue to flow through `Cow::Owned(String)`.
- **Release profile** — `opt-level = 3` (was `"z"`), `lto = "fat"` written
  explicitly. Release builds pass `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"` so LLVM
  emits instructions for the host's exact micro-architecture (skipped for
  cross-target builds and debug). `panic = "abort"` is intentionally NOT set —
  it would break `try {} catch {}` and `transaction {}` which depend on
  `catch_unwind`.
- **`mimalloc` global allocator** on Windows targets (replaces `HeapAlloc`,
  the dominant source of allocator churn). Linux / macOS keep the system
  allocator.
- **Pre-sized buffers** — `jwc_to_json` seeds the output `String` with
  `String::with_capacity(256)`, `jwc_write_json_string` reserves
  `s.len() + 2` up front.

### Fixed
- **Allocator-free hex encoding** in `jwc_hash_to_hex` — replaces the
  per-byte `format!("{:02x}", b)` (32 tiny `String` allocs per SHA-256) with
  a direct table lookup. Hot enough on chained-hash workloads to dominate
  per-request time on the `/cpu` benchmark.

### Performance

Measured on Intel i5-10400 / 32GB / Win11 with `_my/jwc-app` from
`http-framework-benchmark`, release native, bombardier 15s @ warmup 3s:

| Endpoint | v0.4.0 baseline | v0.4.1 | Δ |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `/ping` | 123,256 | 133,024 | **+7.9%** |
| `/json-small` | 117,729 | 129,032 | **+9.6%** |
| `/json-large` | 13,064 | 13,900 | **+6.4%** |
| `/cpu` | 68 | 123 | **+81%** |

`/cpu` closes the rust-axum gap from 2.80× to 1.55× — already exceeds the
`B5` target of "68 → 110+ RPS" listed for the next phase. `/async-delay` is
dominated by TCP-accept-queue saturation at `c=1000` and the 32-bit
bombardier client; at `c=100` it runs cleanly with zero errors.

## [0.4.0] — Array + Builtin Parity

### Added
- **Array literals** — `[1, 2, 3]`, the empty form `[]`, and heterogeneous
  elements (`[1, "two", true]`). Iterable with `for x in xs`. Works in both the
  interpreter and native AOT.
- **Array builtins** — `range(n)` / `range(start, end)` / `range(start, end,
  step)`, `push(arr, x)` / `append(arr, x)` (in-place), and `join(arr, sep)`
  (O(n)). `length`/`first`/`last`/`contains` now accept arrays directly.
- **Hash builtins** — `sha256`, `sha1`, `md5`, and `hmac_sha256` (lowercase
  hex), backed by a new `src/hash.rs` with known-vector tests (incl. RFC 4231).
- **Custom MIME responses** — `response(body, mime)` (alias `raw`) ships a body
  verbatim under an explicit Content-Type (`; charset=utf-8` appended to
  `text/*`). `text(body)` now works in the interpreter too.
- **Module-level `const`** — top-level `const NAME = expr;` visible read-only in
  routes, functions, middlewares, and main; compile-time rejection of
  non-constant expressions, undeclared references, duplicates, and cycles.
- **Graceful shutdown** — `serve()` drains inflight requests on Ctrl+C with a
  `JWC_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` (default 5s) watchdog; open WebSockets get a `1001`
  close frame (interpreter).

### Changed
- Built-in metadata consolidated into a single source of truth
  (`src/builtins.rs` `BUILTIN_DEFS`); the native-AOT whitelist and lint pass
  derive from it. The interpreter's built-in evaluators were split into
  `src/runner/builtins.rs`.

### Fixed
- Native AOT now accepts `hash_password` / `verify_password` (argon2id) — they
  were previously interpreter-only and rejected at native-build time.
- `ok`, `not_found`, `no_content`, `bad_request`, and `internal_error` no longer
  error with "Unknown function" in the interpreter; they are dispatched in both
  runtimes. (Remaining error-body shape differences are tracked in
  `docs/parity-notes.md`, deferred to v0.4.1.)
