//! The durable job queue behind `job` and `dispatch` (jobs.md).
//!
//! # Durable only
//!
//! 0.9 shipped two drivers and defaulted to the wrong one: `JWC_QUEUE_DRIVER`
//! chose between an in-memory `VecDeque` and Postgres, and unset meant
//! memory. A queue whose default loses every pending job on deploy has no
//! guarantee anyone can build on, and the failure is invisible — the
//! enqueue succeeded, the work simply never happened. There is one driver
//! here, and it is the database the program already has.
//!
//! # Two tables the runtime owns
//!
//! `_jwc_jobs` and `_jwc_jobs_dead`, created at boot the way
//! `_jwc_migrations` is. They are deliberately *not* part of the declared
//! schema: `jwc migrate new` would then want to diff them, `jwc migrate
//! down` would want to drop them, and a snapshot would carry rows of
//! pending work as if they were schema.
//!
//! # One row at a time, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
//!
//! The lease is a claim two processes cannot both hold: the `SELECT …
//! FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` inside the `UPDATE` means a second worker
//! walks past a row the first is taking rather than blocking on it. A
//! worker that dies mid-job leaves `leased_until` in the past, and the
//! next poll picks the job up again — at-least-once, which is the only
//! delivery guarantee a queue on a database can actually make.
//!
//! That is worth saying plainly: **a handler must tolerate running
//! twice.** Deleting a row it already deleted is fine; charging a card
//! twice is not, and the fix is an idempotency key in the handler, not a
//! stronger promise here.
/// # Every bind is text
///
/// `db::run` sends `Option<String>`, so a placeholder Postgres infers as
/// `int` from a `$3::int` cast is one it then refuses to deserialise —
/// "error serializing parameter". The casts here are therefore written
