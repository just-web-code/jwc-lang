//! Applying migrations — `up`, `down`, `status`, `verify`.
//!
//! The generator half is `migrate.rs` and never touches a database. This
//! half does nothing else.
//!
//! ## The lock
//!
//! Every command takes a **session-level advisory lock** before it looks at
//! anything. Two deploys rolling out at once then serialise instead of
//! interleaving half a migration each, and a session lock (rather than a
//! transaction one) also covers the `no-transaction` files, which have no
//! transaction to hang a lock on.
//!
//! ## The bookkeeping table
//!
//! `_jwc_migrations` records what ran, when, and the checksum of the file
//! that ran. The checksum is what turns "someone edited an applied
//! migration" from a silent divergence into a line in `jwc migrate status`.
