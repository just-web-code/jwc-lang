//!
//! Scope is v0.24.0's plus the join layer: `select` with joins, `insert` /
//! `update` / `delete` on one table, the expression core, middleware
//! chains, and the error model. Every `select` goes through
//! [`crate::query_sql`] — the join compiler subsumes the single-table case,
//! so there is no second SQL builder to keep in step. What it cannot emit
//! yet (aggregates, a view as a source) says which release it waits for
//! rather than producing an approximation.
//!
//! There are two backends — this interpreter and the native AOT pass in
//! `src/native/` — and this one is the reference. `DEFERRED-2`, which froze
//! the native path, was withdrawn in 0.9.903; the two are held to identical
//! responses by a differential harness rather than by one of them not running.
