//! The 1.0 AST to Rust.
//!
//! Written against `crate::ast`, not ported from the 0.9.x codegen — that
//! one named `RouteDecl` with a bare path, `MountDecl`, `ModelKind` and
//! `validate body`, and none of those exist. What *is* carried over is the
//! shape of the emission: one Rust `async fn` per route, values as the
//! prelude's `V`, and built-ins as `jwc_b_*` calls into the prelude.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! This pass covers the tier that needs no database: routes, control flow,
//! expressions, and the built-ins the prelude already implements. Anything
//! outside it is refused by [`reject_unsupported`] with the construct
//! named, because a native build that silently dropped a query would be far
//! worse than one that will not start.
//!
//! Queries are the next tier and they are cheap here, which is the reason
//! this backend is worth rebuilding at all: `query_sql` already lowers a
//! query to a SQL string and a parameter list at compile time, so codegen
//! embeds the same string the interpreter sends. There is no second query
//! compiler and no semantics that can drift.
