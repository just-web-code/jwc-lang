//! Native AOT: a `.jwc` project becomes a Rust crate, then a single binary.
//!
//! ## Why this exists again
//!
//! The v0.25.0 cutover deleted the whole backend — 5,149 lines of codegen
//! and 5,030 of prelude — and the roadmap entry that authorised it gave one
//! reason: a second implementation of the query compiler would have to move
//! in lockstep with the first, and every query change would need a
//! differential case to prove they agreed.
//!
//! That reason does not survive the 1.0 front-end. `query_sql` already
//! lowers a query to **a SQL string and a parameter list at compile time**
//! — `Built { sql, params, shape, … }` — so codegen embeds the very same
//! string the interpreter would send. There is no second query compiler to
//! keep in step, and no query semantics that can drift, because there is
//! only one.
//!
//! What codegen does own is the statement and expression tier: control
//! flow, calls, builders, and the shape of the generated handler. That is
//! the part written against the 1.0 AST rather than ported from the 0.9.x
//! one, which named `RouteDecl`, `MountDecl`, `ModelKind` and `validate
//! body` — none of which exist now.
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! * `prelude/` — the runtime the generated crate includes, restored
//!   unchanged from before the cutover. It references no AST type.
//! * `codegen.rs` — the 1.0 AST to Rust.
//! * this file — scaffolding: the manifest, the cargo invocation, and
//!   where the binary lands.
