# names.md — lexical structure, modules, name resolution

Normative. Clause references elsewhere in the spec use the form `names §3.2`.

Closes gaps **#2**, **#18**, **#34** (bare identifiers in `where`), **N5**
(`import` semantics, undeclared free functions), and the naming half of
**#35**.

## 1. Source text

1.1 A source file is UTF-8. A BOM, if present, is skipped.

1.2 Line terminators are LF or CRLF; both count as one line for diagnostics.

1.3 Whitespace separates tokens and is otherwise insignificant.

1.4 A **line comment** starts with `//` and runs to end of line. `--` where a
declaration, table member or statement belongs is `E0901`, naming `//`. In an
expression `a -- b` is `a - (-b)` and stays arithmetic.

1.5 A **doc comment** starts with `///` and runs to end of line. Consecutive
doc-comment lines form one doc block. A doc block attaches to the immediately
following declaration, column definition or class field. A doc block followed
by anything else is an error (`E0104: doc comment attaches to nothing`).
Doc blocks on tables and columns become `COMMENT ON` (schema §7).

1.6 `//` inside a string literal is text, not a comment.

1.7 A **block comment** opens with `/*` and closes with `*/`. Block comments
**nest**: `/*` inside one opens a deeper level, and the comment ends at the
`*/` that closes the outermost. A block that reaches end of input unclosed is
an error (`E0101: unterminated block comment`). A block comment does not
document anything — only `///` (§1.5) reaches `COMMENT ON`.

---

## 2. Tokens

2.1 **Identifier** — `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*`. Identifiers are
case-sensitive. A leading `_` is not permitted (it is reserved for compiler
temporaries in generated SQL).

2.2 **Number** — decimal integer or decimal fraction: `[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?`.
No underscores, no hex, no exponent. An integer literal that does not fit
`bigint` is an error (`E0107`). A fractional literal is `numeric`, never a
binary float (types §2.4).

2.3 **String** — `"..."` with the escapes `\"` `\\` `\n` `\r` `\t` `\0`
`\u{XXXX}`. A literal newline inside a string is an error.

2.4 **Raw string** — `r"..."` with no escape processing except `\"`. Used for
regular expressions: `pattern(r"^[a-z0-9-]{3,40}$")`.

2.5 **Sigil** — `@name` (a local, parameter or path parameter, §5.2)
§5.3). The sigil is part of the token; `@ name` is an error.

2.6 **There are no reserved words.** Every word the grammar gives meaning to
is also a legal identifier; the parser decides by position.

This is not laxity. `route`, `server`, `size`, `max`, `check`, `key`, `text`,
`date` and `int` all appear as ordinary column names, rule names or builtin
namespaces in this specification's own sample — `route varchar(200)` in the
audit table, `max(90)` on a class field, `int(…)` and `date.now()` as calls.
A reserved-word list would forbid the language's own examples.

The words with grammatical meaning are:

```
after     and       as        asc       assert    backoff   break     buffered
by        cache     cascade   catch     check     class     close     conflict
const     continue  cross     database  default   delete    desc      dispatch
do        else      enum      error     errorHandler except    exists    false
first     for       foreign   from      full      function  group     having
identity  if        ilike     import    in        index     inner     insert
into      job       join      key       left      let       like      limit
max       message   middleware namespace no        not       nothing   null
nulls     of        on        open      or        orderby   page      primary
private   provides  raises    references requires  restrict  retries   return
right     route     routes    schema    select    server    service   set
size      socket    static    table     test      throw     transaction transient
true      under     unique    update    use       using     view      was
where     while     with
```

A word in a position where the grammar expects that keyword is that keyword.
Everywhere else it is an identifier. In practice this bites in exactly one
place — a *statement-leading* word is effectively reserved at the start of a
statement — and that is the position where a column name never appears.

2.7 The HTTP method names `GET POST PUT PATCH DELETE HEAD OPTIONS` are
contextual: they are keywords only immediately after `route`.

2.8 **Removed keywords.** `entity`, `dbcontext`, `with` *(as a query
clause)*, `via`, `nav`, `validate`, `new`, `patch`, `group` *(as a route
grouping keyword)*, `mount`, `dome`. Encountering one in a declaration
position produces `E0900` naming the replacement (routing §11).

## 3. Case convention

3.1 **PascalCase** — things whose shape you declare: `database`, `table`,
`view`, `class`, `enum`, `service`, `middleware`, `error`.

3.2 **snake_case** — columns, functions, locals, parameters, enum members,
JSON keys, `namespace` segments, `schema` names, `server { }` keys.

3.3 A name that violates §3.1 or §3.2 produces `W0101`, a warning. It is not
an error: casing carries no semantics, and physical naming (§4) is derived
mechanically either way. `jwc lint --deny-warnings` promotes it.

3.4 `jwc fmt` never renames. Renaming is a schema-visible act (migrations §6).

---

## 4. Physical names

4.1 The physical name of a `schema`, `table`, `view`, `enum` or column is the
**snake_case transform** of its declared name. No pluralisation, no
singularisation, no prefix, no suffix.

The transform inserts `_` before each uppercase letter that follows a
lowercase letter or digit, or that is followed by a lowercase letter, then
lowercases everything:

| Declared | Physical |
|---|---|
| `Accounts` | `accounts` |
| `InvoiceLines` | `invoice_lines` |
| `ApiKeys` | `api_keys` |
| `OrgWithMembers` | `org_with_members` |
| `created_at` | `created_at` |

4.2 `as "literal"` overrides the transform and is used verbatim, quoted in
DDL. It is the only escape hatch and it is visible at the declaration site:

```
table Accounts of App.auth as "tbl_user_accounts" { ... }
created_at timestamptz as "createdAt";
```

4.3 Two objects in one schema whose physical names collide is an error
(`E0110`), naming both declaration sites. This can only happen through §4.2.

4.4 The physical name of an *enum member* is its declared name verbatim.
Enum members are already snake_case by §3.2.

4.5 **The database name is never declared.** It comes from `DATABASE_URL`.
`database App : Postgres` declares a *connection*, and `App` is the name that
qualifies schemas in source. See config §2.

4.6 The database name is therefore **not** part of any physical name.
`schema billing of App;` creates the schema `billing`, not `app_billing`;
`App.billing.Invoices` is `billing.invoices` in DDL. The `App.` prefix exists
to make source references unambiguous, and it stops at the source.

## 5. Scopes and resolution

There are exactly four name spaces, distinguished lexically. This is the
whole rule, and §5.3 is the clause that makes `where org_id == org_id`
impossible.

### 5.1 Declaration space (bare PascalCase / dotted)

Types, tables, views, classes, services, middleware, errors and enums live in
one **flat, global** space keyed by their declared name. `import` does not
scope it (§6.3). A duplicate declared name anywhere in the program is an
error (`E0111`), naming both sites.

Database objects are additionally addressable by their qualified path:
`App.auth.Accounts`. The qualified form is **required** in `from`, `into`,
`references` and `join` (queries §2.1). The bare form is used everywhere
else, including enum member access (`MemberRole.owner`).

### 5.2 `@name` — everything bound outside a query

One sigil. `@name` is a **local**, a **function parameter** or a **path
parameter**, and which one it is falls out of scope rather than out of
spelling:

- a local or parameter in scope wins;
- otherwise a path parameter of the enclosing route or middleware.

The two cannot collide, because a `let` may not shadow a parameter or a path
parameter that is already in scope (§5.5, `E0214`). `@name` is `E0903`,
naming `@name`.

Path parameters are typed at their binding site (routing §4) and are **never**
strings by default. `@org_id` in a route under
`routes "/api/v1/orgs/{org_id: bigint}"` has type `bigint`. A path parameter
exists only inside a `route` block, a `middleware` body/`after` block, or a
`routes` block's `use` arguments; `@name` in a service that names no local is
`E0801`.

### 5.3 The three kinds of name

Inside a **query clause** — a `join ... on` expression, `where`, `having`,
`group by`, `orderby`, a projection field, an aggregate filter, or a
`page after` expression — every name says what it is:

| | |
|---|---|
| `B.column` | a column of binding `B` (queries §2.4) |
| `@name` | a local, parameter or path parameter (§5.2) |
| `Name`, `Name.member` | the declaration space (§5.1) |

An unqualified column is `E0904`, naming the binding it should have carried.
`E0210` covers the opposite slip — a bare name in a query clause that is no
column but does match a local in scope: *`'account_id'` is not a column of any
binding here; did you mean `@account_id`?*

The two positions that are not references take no qualifier: a `set` target
and an `insert` object key name a column of the table being written.

**Outside a query clause the sigil is optional.** In a route body, a service,
a `for`, an argument list, there is no column for a local to be confused with,
so `attempt` and `@attempt` are the same reference and both compile:

```jwc
for (let attempt in [1, 2, 3]) {
    console.writeln("Attempt #" + string.of(attempt));
}
```

`jwc fmt` leaves each as written. A bare name outside a query clause that is
neither a local nor a declaration is `E0211: unknown name`; without it a
mistyped local would quietly evaluate to its own name as text.

Because a column carries its binding, `where T.org_id == T.org_id` can only
mean the tautology it looks like. The compiler warns — `W0104: comparison is
always true` — because a tautology in a `where` is never intentional.

The declaration space (§5.1) is not sigiled: `MemberRole.owner`,
`AuthService.login(...)`, `context.account_id`, `request.header(...)` and
`App.auth.Accounts` are names, not locals.

### 5.4 Bindings inside a query

Every `select` binds exactly one name for its source, written after `select`:

```jwc no-compile
select Accounts from App.auth.Accounts     // binds `Accounts`
select a from App.auth.Accounts            // binds `a`
```

The binder is **mandatory**. `select from App.org.MemberAccess` does not
parse. This closes #18: a view query has a binder like every other query.

Each `join` may bind its own name, defaulting to the joined table's declared
name:

```jwc no-compile
left join App.auth.Accounts inviter on inviter.id == Invites.invited_by
left join App.auth.Accounts on Accounts.id == Members.account_id
```

Two bindings with the same name in one query is an error (`E0212`), which is
what makes self-joins expressible (#1): the second occurrence must be
aliased.

A column names its binding (queries §2.4), so a name cannot be ambiguous
between two of them: the qualifier is what decides.

### 5.5 Locals

`let name = …;` introduces a local; a reference to it is `name`, or `@name`
where §5.3 requires the sigil. A `let` may not shadow a local, parameter or path parameter that is already
in scope (`E0214`). Blocks nest; a local goes out of scope at the end of its
block.

A `for` binder is declared the same way: `for (let x in xs)`. The `let` is
**mandatory** (`E0902`); without it the loop was the one place in the language
where a name appeared without being declared.

Assignment to a local (`x = expr;`, or `@x = expr;`) is permitted and does
not change its type. Assignment to a field (`x.y = expr;`) does not parse: load-modify-save
is a declared non-goal.

## 6. Namespaces, imports, packages

### 6.1 `namespace`

6.1.1 A file **may** declare `namespace a.b.c;` as its first declaration.
At most one per file.

6.1.2 A file without a `namespace` belongs to the root namespace.

6.1.3 The namespace does **not** scope names (§5.1). It exists to (a) name
the file's contents in diagnostics and `jwc openapi` tags, (b) be the target
of `import`, and (c) give `jwc fmt` and the LSP a module identity.

6.1.4 Convention, enforced as `W0102`: a file's namespace matches its path
under `src/` with `/` replaced by `.` and the extension dropped.

### 6.2 `import`

6.2.1 `import x.y;` declares a dependency. Its target is resolved in this
order:

1. a namespace declared by some file in this project → **namespace import**;
2. a key in `jwcproj.json`'s `dependencies` → **package import**;
3. neither → `E0201: unknown import 'x.y'`.

6.2.2 If the name resolves under *both* rule 1 and rule 2, that is
`E0203: 'x' is both a local namespace and a package dependency` — rename one.
There is no precedence rule, deliberately.

6.2.3 A **package import** additionally brings the package's builtin
namespace into the declaration space: `import redis;` is what makes
`redis.rate_limit(...)` resolvable (builtins §8).

### 6.3 What `import` does and does not do

6.3.1 `import` does **not** restrict visibility. Because the declaration
space is flat (§5.1), a name is reachable whether or not you import it.

6.3.2 `import` **is** checked. Referring to a name declared in another
namespace without importing that namespace is `E0202`, naming the missing
import line. This is the enforcement half of N5, and it is what makes the
import list a truthful dependency graph without building a visibility system
(deferred; ROADMAP §7).

6.3.3 An `import` whose namespace contributes no referenced name is `W0103`
(unused import).

6.3.4 Import cycles between namespaces are permitted. Namespaces are not
compilation units.

### 6.4 Free functions

6.4.1 A `function` declared at top level is a **free function**. It is
callable unqualified from anywhere in the program, subject to §6.3.2.

6.4.2 A call to a name that is neither a free function, a builtin
(builtins §1), nor `Service.method` is `E0204: unknown function`. There is
no implicit declaration. This closes the second half of N5: the sample's
`invite_body`, `random_token`, `next_invoice_number`, `verify_signature` and
`send_email` each need a declaration site or a builtin (builtins §7).

6.4.3 A free function's parameters must be annotated; its return type is
inferred unless the function is exported by a package (types §10.2).

*(`E0350` was reserved for a missing annotation. The grammar requires
`name: type`, so a parameter without one does not parse and the parser's
own error arrives first, naming the missing token. The code stays reserved
rather than implemented as an unreachable check.)*

---


## 5.6 `const`

```jwc
const PAGE_SIZE = 50;
const LIMITS = [10, 50, 100];
```

Top-level, read-only, one namespace for the whole program: two with one
name is `E0215`, the same ambiguity two tables with one name would be.

The right-hand side is a **constant expression** — literals, operators,
`? :`, array and object literals, and other consts. Anything else is
`E0216`. The rule is a whitelist rather than a list of forbidden things: a
blacklist has to name every way to reach the outside world and is wrong the
moment one is added, and the failure mode of this direction is a diagnostic
rather than a program that reads the database while it loads.

A local of the same name shadows it, the way a parameter shadows one.

Both backends evaluate it the same way: the interpreter at the use, codegen
by emitting the expression where the name appears. There is no
initialisation order, because there is nothing to initialise.

## 7. Diagnostics introduced here

| `E0204` | unknown function |
| `E0210` | bare identifier in a query clause is not a column but matches a local |
| `E0211` | unknown name: not a column here, and not a local or declaration |

| `E0900` | removed keyword from the pre-1.0 language |
| `E0901` | `--` where a comment was meant; comments are `//` |
| `E0902` | a `for` binder without `let` |
| `E0903` | `@name` — the sigil is `@` |
| `W0101` | case convention |
| `W0102` | namespace does not match file path |
| `W0103` | unused import |
| `W0104` | comparison is always true |

### 7.1 The parser's recovery diagnostics

`E0001`–`E0018` are raised by the parser when the token it reads is not one
[`grammar.ebnf`](./grammar.ebnf) admits at that position. Each names the
construct being parsed, so the code alone says where to look; the message
carries the token that was actually found.

| Code | Raised while parsing | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `E0001` | any construct | expected a specific token, name, integer or string literal |
| `E0002` | the top level | expected a declaration |
| `E0004` | a foreign key | expected `delete`/`update` after `on`, or a referential action |
| `E0005` | an `error` declaration | expected an HTTP status code, or one outside `100..=599` |
| `E0006` | a `service` body | expected `function` — a service holds nothing else |
| `E0007` | a `middleware` binder | expected `@name` |
| `E0008` | a `routes` body | expected `route` or `socket` — blocks do not nest |
| `E0009` | a `route` header | not an HTTP method |
| `E0010` | an `errorHandler` body | expected `catch` — a handler holds nothing else |
| `E0011` | a type | expected a type argument, as in `varchar(120)` |
| `E0012` | an object literal | expected `@name` after `...` |
| `E0013` | an object literal | expected an object key, or `:`/`=` after one |
| `E0014` | an expression | expected an expression |
| `E0015` | a query | `select` with no binder before `from` |
| `E0016` | a join | expected `left` or `inner` — `right`/`full`/`cross` are not grammar |
| `E0017` | a join result | expected `one`, `many` or `group` after `as` |
| `E0018` | a spread | `except` without a parenthesised list |

Several of these state a rule the grammar does not carry — that a status
code is bounded, that `right join` was left out on purpose — which is why
they are tabled rather than delegated to the EBNF.
