# writes.md — `insert`, `update`, `delete`, and `transaction`

Normative. Closes gaps **#6**, **#7**, **#21**, **#43**, and **G7** /
**G8** from error-model.md.

---

## 1. Shared rules

1.1 A write statement targets exactly one table, always fully qualified.
Writing to a `view` is `E0601`.

1.2 A write is a **statement** and an **expression**. As an expression its
value is its projection (types §5.3); as a statement its value is discarded.
A write with no projection has type `Void` and may not be assigned.

1.3 Column names in the object literal / `set` clause are the *declared*
column names of the target table. A name with no column is `E0602`.

1.4 `private` and `server` columns may be written by an **explicit** entry,
never by a spread (types §9.4).

---

## 2. `insert`

```jwc
insert Accounts into App.auth.Accounts {
    ...@req,
    password_hash = @password_hash
} as { Accounts.id, Accounts.email, Accounts.display_name, Accounts.created_at };
```

2.1 Always exactly one row. Bulk insert is `for (let line in @req.lines) { … }`,
which emits one statement per element in the enclosing transaction. A
multi-row form is `DEFERRED-8`.

2.2 `as { }` is the `RETURNING` list; the result is a `Record` (not `T?` —
an insert that returns no row is impossible without `on conflict`).

2.3 `on conflict (cols) do nothing` makes the result `Record?`. This is the
form that fixes the sample's webhook TOCTOU (G8): select-then-insert is a
race, `on conflict do nothing` is not.

```jwc
let payment = insert Payments into App.billing.Payments { ...@req, provider = "stripe" }
    on conflict (provider_ref) do nothing
    as { Payments.id };

if (@payment == null) { return { status: "duplicate" }; }
```

2.4 `on conflict (cols) do update set …` is the upsert. `cols` must name a
declared unique constraint or unique index (`E0603`).

2.5 Omitting `on conflict`'s column list is legal only when the table has
exactly one unique constraint (`E0604`).

---

## 3. `update`

```jwc
update Members of App.org.Members
    set role = @req.role
    where Members.org_id == @org_id and Members.account_id == @account_id
    as { Members.org_id, Members.account_id, Members.role }
    first;
```

3.1 With no `first`, the statement updates every matching row; the
projection is `Record[]`.

3.2 With `first`, exactly one row is updated and the projection is
`Record?`.

3.3 `set col =? expr` skips the assignment when `expr` is null. `set ...x`
applies the field-wise rule of types §9.2.

3.4 An `update` with no `where` is `E0605`. There is no accidental
whole-table update. `where true` is the explicit opt-in.

3.5 Empty spread — see types §9.5. The statement is skipped and the
projection reads the current row.

3.6 A `set` expression that reads the row's **own columns** is emitted as
SQL, not evaluated in the process:

```jwc no-compile
set value = value + 1
```

becomes `SET value = (value + 1)`. Evaluating it here would need a read
first, and two callers doing that both read the same number — the race
§2.3 is about, in the one place where it is easiest to write by accident.
Everything else in a `set` is still a bind parameter.

---

## 4. `update … first` and `delete … first` lowering (#43)

`first` on a write has no direct SQL form; it lowers to a locked row
selection:

```sql
UPDATE billing.subscriptions t
   SET status = $1, canceled_at = $2
 WHERE t.ctid = (
        SELECT s.ctid FROM billing.subscriptions s
         WHERE s.org_id = $3 AND s.status <> 'canceled'
         ORDER BY s.id
         FOR UPDATE
         LIMIT 1)
RETURNING …;
```

- `FOR UPDATE` is **always** emitted. Two concurrent `cancel(org_id)` calls
  serialise; the second sees the already-canceled row and matches nothing.
- `SKIP LOCKED` is not available in 1.0. Work-claiming is `DEFERRED-9`.
- The same determinism rule as `select … first` applies: `orderby` is
  required unless the `where` provably selects at most one row
  (queries §5.2, `E0520`).

---

## 5. `delete` (#6)

```jwc
delete Invites from App.org.Invites
    where Invites.id == @invite_id and Invites.org_id == @org_id
    as { Invites.id }
    first;
```

5.1 `delete` takes a projection. With `first` the result is `Record?`, which
is what makes "404 if it did not exist" writable:

```jwc no-compile
let gone = delete Invites from App.org.Invites where … as { Invites.id } first
    or throw NotFound("taklifnoma topilmadi");
```

5.2 Without a projection the result is `Void`. There is no row count in
1.0; the projection is strictly more informative and does not tempt anyone
into `if (n == 0)`.

5.3 A `delete` with no `where` is `E0605`.

---

## 6. `raw` escape hatch

```jwc no-compile
let rows = raw("select … from … where x = {}", @x);
```

6.1 `raw(sql, args…)` is the only way to write SQL by hand. `{}` are
positional bind placeholders; the arguments are bound, never interpolated.
A `{}` count mismatch is `E0610`.

Each `{}` expands to `($n::text)` — the same "bound as text, cast in SQL"
rule the compiler follows everywhere (queries §7.3). Hand-written SQL
carries no type information to derive the cast from, so the **author**
writes it:

```jwc no-compile
raw("select … where org_id = ({})::bigint", @org_id)
```

Without the cast Postgres infers the column's type for the parameter and
refuses the text, which is an error at the first call rather than a wrong
answer later.

6.2 `raw` is **forbidden inside a `view`** (`E0611`) — a view is a
snapshotted object and a hand-written body cannot be diffed.

6.3 A `raw` result is **`Raw`**. There is no `as { }` on it: an annotation
would be a shape the compiler has to take on trust, and the value would
still be whatever the database sent. `Raw` splices into a response the way
a `jsonb` column does and is not read field-wise, which is the honest shape
for text whose structure the compiler cannot know (types §9).

This is the one unchecked boundary in the language, and it is unchecked in
both directions: what a `raw` query selects is not compared against the
schema, so a `private` column named in one **is** returned (schema §3.1
describes the guarantee the query compiler gives, not one `raw` inherits).
`jwc explain` lists every occurrence with a count (queries §7.4); read it
before trusting a program's `private` columns to have stayed private.

The SQL itself must be a **literal** (`E0610`): a computed string cannot
have its placeholders counted, and counting them is the only thing standing
between this construct and interpolation.

6.4 `raw` exists so that CTEs, window functions, recursive queries and
full-text search are reachable without the query compiler growing them
(ROADMAP §7). It is a valve, and its usage count is the measurement of which
feature to add next.

## 7. `buffered`

### 7.1 The form

```jwc no-compile
middleware AccessLog {
    after {
        insert Requests into App.audit.Requests {
            route  = request.route(),
            status = response.status(),
            micros = response.duration_us()
        } buffered;
    }
}
```

`buffered` hands the row to a batch writer and returns. The statement is
the one the query compiler produced for that `insert` — `buffered` changes
who sends it and when, not what is sent.

### 7.2 Rules

| | |
|---|---|
| `as { … }` | `E0614` — it answers before the row exists |
| inside `transaction { }` | `E0612` — the row is written later, on another connection; a rollback would not take it back |
| `on conflict` | `E0613` — a resolution nobody observes is a row silently not written |
| its raise set | **empty**. There is no caller left to raise to; a constraint the row violates is counted, not thrown |

That last row is what makes a logging `after` block possible at all: an
ordinary insert there is `E0811`, because an `after` block runs once the
response is decided and has no handler behind it.

### 7.3 Why it exists

An `after` block is awaited **before** the response is returned
(middleware §5.1). So an ordinary insert there puts a database round trip
in front of every response: every request waits for its own log row.

`builtins.md` §10 listed `log_insert` as "overlapped `insert into` for no
benefit". The benefit is that round trip: measured, batching moved 6.0k
rows/s at 500-row batches to 20.3k at 5000, with request throughput
unchanged.

### 7.4 What is given up

**Durability.** Rows sit in memory until the next flush, so a crash loses
at most `JWC_LOG_FLUSH_MS` of them, and a sustained overload drops rows
rather than growing without bound. Drops are counted, not silent:
`jwc_log_dropped_total`.

Both are right for telemetry and wrong for anything you would bill on,
which is why this is a word the call site writes and not what `insert`
does by default.

### 7.5 The writer

Rows are grouped by statement and merged into one multi-row `INSERT`,
chunked to Postgres's 65 535-parameter ceiling. One statement per row
would move the latency off the request and leave the database doing the
same work.

| Env var | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `JWC_LOG_QUEUE` | 10000 | channel capacity; full means rows are dropped |
| `JWC_LOG_BATCH` | 2000 | rows per statement |
| `JWC_LOG_FLUSH_MS` | 200 | longest a row waits, and the crash-loss bound |

`/metrics`: `jwc_log_queue_depth`, `jwc_log_queue_capacity`,
`jwc_log_dropped_total`, `jwc_log_written_total`, `jwc_log_failed_total`,
`jwc_log_batches_total`. Depth against capacity is how the writer falling
behind is visible before it starts dropping.

---

## 8. `transaction` (G7)

```jwc
transaction {
    let org = insert Orgs into App.org.Orgs { ...@req }
        as { Orgs.id, Orgs.slug, Orgs.name, Orgs.created_at };
    insert Members into App.org.Members { org_id = @org.id, account_id = @owner_id, role = MemberRole.owner };
    return @org;
}
```

### 7.1 Semantics

| Event | Outcome |
|---|---|
| block completes, or `return` inside it | **COMMIT**, then the value is returned |
| a `throw` or a fault escapes the block | **ROLLBACK**, then the error propagates |
| a postfix `catch` handles an error inside | `SAVEPOINT` / `ROLLBACK TO` (errors §7) |

`return` inside a `transaction` commits and returns from the **enclosing
function**, not just the block. There is no other reading; the sample
depends on it in three places.

### 7.2 The errorHandler runs *outside* the transaction

The rollback happens first, the connection is released, and only then does
`errorHandler` run — on a fresh connection. This is the fix for G7: an
`errorHandler` arm that logs to `App.audit.Events` would otherwise issue
statements on a connection Postgres has already put in `25P02` and turn
every 404 into a 500.

### 7.3 Nesting is a compile error (E13)

A `transaction` block whose call graph reaches another `transaction` block is
`E0620`, reported at the inner site with the call path. Detecting it
statically is possible because there are no function values (types §1).

### 7.4 Scope

A `transaction` may appear in a `service` function. It may not appear in a
`route`, a `middleware`, an `after` block, or an `errorHandler` arm
(`E0621`) — those are HTTP-shaped, and a transaction spanning middleware
would hold a connection across the whole request.

## 9. Constraint violations become errors (#30)

A write that violates a constraint carrying a message becomes a declared
error; one that violates a message-less constraint is a fault. The full
mapping is errors §6, and the mechanism — matching the violated constraint by
its generated name — is schema §8.

Because the raise set of a function includes the constraints of the tables it
writes (errors §3), a route that inserts into `Payments` *knows at compile
time* that it can raise the `provider_ref` conflict, and `errorHandler`
exhaustiveness covers it.

---
