# middleware.md — ordering, composition, `after`, and `context`

Normative. Closes gaps **#13**, **#14**, **#37**, and **G5**/**N7** from
error-model.md.

---

## 1. Shape

```jwc
middleware RequireOrgMember(@org_id: bigint)
    requires RequireAuth
    provides org_id: bigint, role: MemberRole
{
    let account_id = context.account_id;

    let access = select MA from App.org.MemberAccess
        where org_id == @org_id and account_id == $account_id
        first
        or throw Forbidden("siz bu tashkilot a'zosi emassiz");

    context.org_id = @org_id;
    context.role   = $access.role;
}
```

Three declaration clauses, all optional, all checked:

| Clause | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `(@name: T, …)` | path parameters this middleware reads (#13) |
| `requires A, B` | middleware that must run before this one (#13) |
| `provides k: T, …` | context keys this middleware sets (#17-adjacent) |

---

## 2. Path-parameter binders (#13)

2.1 A middleware that reads `@org_id` must declare it. Reading an undeclared
`@name` is `E0801`.

2.2 At **every attachment site**, the route's binder set (routing §3.3) must
contain every declared binder with a matching type (`E0802`), reported at the
`use` site, not at the middleware.

This is the gap the sample walked into: `RequireOrgMember` read `@org_id`
from whatever route happened to have one, and attaching it to a route without
one was a runtime surprise.

---

## 3. `requires` (#13, #37)

3.1 `requires A` asserts that `A` runs before this middleware in the resolved
chain of every route it is attached to. Violation is `E0803`, naming the
route and printing the resolved chain.

3.2 `requires` does **not** insert `A` into the chain. Declared dependencies
are checked, not satisfied automatically; inserting middleware the reader
cannot see at the `use` site is exactly the invisible-order problem.

3.3 This is what makes `RequireOrgAdmin` honest. It reads `context.role`,
which only `RequireOrgMember` sets, so it declares
`requires RequireOrgMember`, and a route that lists `RequireOrgAdmin` without
it fails to compile.

---

## 4. Composition and order (#14, #37)

### 4.1 The resolved chain

For a route, the chain is:

1. the enclosing `routes` block's `use` list, **in written order**;
2. then the `route`'s own `use` list, **in written order**.

Route-level `use` **appends**; it never replaces. A name appearing in both
is `E0804` (duplicate in chain), because the intended meaning — run twice,
or reorder — is not guessable.

### 4.2 Execution

Each middleware body runs to completion in chain order. A middleware
completes in one of three ways:

| Outcome | Effect |
|---|---|
| falls off the end | the chain continues |
| `return <Response>` | **short-circuit** — the chain stops, that response is used |
| `throw E(...)` | the chain stops, `errorHandler` produces the response |

`return` from a middleware is reserved for deliberately **non-error**
responses: a redirect, a `304`, a `202`. Errors use `throw` (errors §2.2,
E14). A middleware that `return`s a 4xx/5xx builder is `W0801` pointing at
the `throw` equivalent.

A **bare** `return;` is `E0812`. It is none of the three outcomes: it stops
the chain and answers `204`, which is a response nobody wrote. Both ways of
arriving at it are mistakes and neither is visible in the source —
`middleware RequireAuth { if (…) { return; } }` answered `204 No Content`
to an unauthenticated caller instead of a `401`, and an author who wrote it
meaning "I am done, carry on" — what a bare `return` does in every language
where middleware is a function — switched the endpoint off, because the
route body never ran and every caller got a `204`. The fix is one word:
`return noContent();` for the response, `throw` for the rejection, and
deleting the `return` for the third reading.

A bare `return;` inside an `after` block (§5.3) or a socket handler
(routing §9.2) is a different statement in a different body and stays
legal — those bodies have no response to produce.

### 4.3 `after` blocks run in reverse

Every middleware that **started** — including the one that short-circuited —
runs its `after` block, in reverse chain order. Middleware that never started
does not.

---

## 5. `after` (#14, G5, N7)

```jwc
middleware Audit {
    after {
        let method = request.method();
        let status = response.status();

        if ($method == "GET" or $status >= 400) { return; }

        let path = request.route();
        insert into App.audit.Events {
            org_id   = context.org_id?,
            actor_id = context.account_id?,
            action   = $method,
            entity   = $path,
            ip       = request.client_ip()
        };
    }
}
```

5.1 An `after` block runs for **every** outcome: normal response,
short-circuit, and error — including the response the `errorHandler`
produced. `response.status()` is therefore the status actually being sent,
and `response.duration_ms()` / `response.duration_us()` measure the whole
request — the chain included, not just the handler. All three are `E0734`
anywhere else, because outside an `after` block there is no response yet.

5.2 `after` runs **after** the `errorHandler`, and after any transaction has
been committed or rolled back (writes §7.2).

5.3 A bare `return;` inside `after` ends **that block only** (N7). It cannot
produce a response; `return <expr>;` in an `after` block is `E0810`.

5.4 An `after` block may modify the response through
`response.set_header(k, v)` / `response.add_header(k, v)`. It may not change
the status or the body: an audit hook that can rewrite a 200 into a 500 is
not a hook.

5.4.1 The two differ, and the difference is the whole reason both exist.
`set_header` **replaces**: the name it names carries one value on the
answer, whether the value came from a response builder, from `with { }`, or
from an earlier `set_header` in the same block. `add_header` **appends**,
leaving every earlier value in place — it is how `Vary`, `Link` and
`Set-Cookie` repeat, which they are allowed to (RFC 9110 §5.3) and which
`with { }` cannot express because a JSON object has one slot per key.

5.4.2 An `after` header wins over the builder's, in both forms: an author
who wrote one in the block that runs last meant it for that answer.

5.4.3 Both backends send the same headers in the same order. The invariant
is the one config §3.9.4 states for the security headers, and it held on
neither side until 0.9.949: `jwc serve` appended for `set_header` too, so a
second write sent the header twice; `jwc build` merged an `after` block's
headers into a map, so `add_header` kept only the last of a repeat and a
`Set-Cookie` written there was lost outright.

5.5 **The raise set of an `after` block must be empty** (errors §3, E7).
An `after` block that can throw is `E0811`, because there is no outer handler
left — the response has already been decided. Writes inside `after` must
therefore be infallible-by-construction or wrapped in a postfix `catch`.

---

## 6. `context`

### 6.1 Typed, declared, dotted

Context is **not** an untyped map. `context.get("account_id")` does not
exist. A middleware declares what it provides:

```
provides account_id: bigint
```

and every reader writes `context.account_id`, which has type `bigint`.

design.md called `context.get/set` "the weakest point" of the invented
surface. This clause is the replacement: the keys are declared, the types are
declared, and the compiler can tell you that nobody set the one you read.

### 6.2 Resolution

`context.k` in a route, middleware or `after` block resolves to the `provides`
declaration of some middleware **that provably runs earlier** in every chain
that reaches this code. If no such middleware exists: `E0820`, naming the
readers and the `requires` clause that would fix it.

### 6.3 `context.k?`

`context.k?` is the nullable read, of type `T?`, for a key that is set only
on some paths (the `Audit` middleware above reads `org_id` on routes that
have no org). Reading `context.k` where the key is not set on every path is
`E0820`; `context.k?` is always legal for a declared key.

### 6.4 Writing

`context.k = v` is legal only inside a middleware that declares `k` in its
`provides` clause (`E0821`). Routes and `after` blocks read only.

---

## 7. Middleware and the error model

7.1 A middleware's raise set participates in exhaustiveness exactly like a
route's (errors §3).

7.2 A middleware may not open a `transaction` (writes §7.4).

7.3 A middleware body may not contain a `route` or another `middleware`.

---

## 8. Ordering summary — worked example

For

```jwc no-compile
routes "/api/v1/orgs/{org_id: bigint}" use RequireAuth, RequireOrgMember, Audit {
    route PATCH "" use RequireOrgAdmin { … }
}
```

the resolved chain of `PATCH /api/v1/orgs/{org_id}` is

```
before:  RequireAuth → RequireOrgMember → Audit → RequireOrgAdmin → handler
after:   Audit.after                                    (reverse order, only Audit has one)
```

`jwc routes` prints exactly this. If `RequireOrgAdmin` had been listed
without `RequireOrgMember` anywhere in the chain, `E0803` would name this
route and print this table.

## 9. Diagnostics introduced here

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `E0801` | undeclared `@name` in a middleware |

| `E0810` | `return <expr>` inside `after` |
| `E0811` | `after` block can raise |

| `E0820` | `context.k` is not provided on every path |
| `E0821` | `context.k = …` without a `provides` declaration |
| `W0801` | middleware returns an error response instead of throwing |
