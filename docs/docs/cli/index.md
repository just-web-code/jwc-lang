# The `jwc` command

One binary. It is the compiler, the server, the migration tool and the
language server.

## Starting

```bash
jwc new shop                      # the smallest thing that runs
jwc new shop --template api       # CRUD over one table, keyset-paginated
jwc new shop --template auth      # accounts, Argon2id passwords, JWT sessions
jwc new shop --path ./services/shop
```

The directory must be missing or empty — `jwc new` will not scaffold over
files you wrote. Every template checks, lints and formats clean on the
first run, and `tests/templates.rs` scaffolds each one and puts the real
toolchain over it, so one that does not is a failing build here rather
than a surprise for you.

## Every day

```bash
jwc check        # parse and type-check
jwc serve        # run it
jwc fmt          # rewrite in canonical form
jwc test           # run every `test` block
```

```bash
jwc fmt src tests           # several inputs
jwc fmt src/app.jwc --stdout   # print the formatted text, rewrite nothing
```

`--stdout` takes one file: concatenating two formatted files produces
something that is not a program, so it refuses rather than doing that.

`jwc check` is the one to put in a pre-commit hook. It needs no database
and no network: the schema is in the source, so the queries are checked
against it without connecting to anything.

## Running

```bash
jwc run app.jwc              # call main() and exit
jwc run --dev                # ...with debug.dump printing
jwc serve                    # the interpreter — the whole language
jwc build                    # a native binary at bin/debug/<name>
jwc build --release          # optimised
jwc build --emit-rust        # the generated Rust, without compiling it
jwc build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

`--target` cross-compiles to a Rust target triple; the toolchain has to
have it already (`rustup target add <triple>`). The binary lands under
`bin/<triple>/<profile>/` so several targets coexist.

`jwc run` calls the program's `main()` and exits. Nothing listens, and a
program that declares no `database` needs no `DATABASE_URL` — that is what
makes a program which only prints something you can actually run. A `main`
that calls `serve(...)` still starts a server, because that is what the
call means; `run` only declines to start one on the program's behalf. A
program with no `main` is `jwc serve`'s job, and `run` says so.

`jwc build` produces one statically-linkable binary with no runtime
dependency on the compiler. It needs a Rust toolchain, because that is
what it hands the generated crate to.

It runs `jwc check` first and builds nothing if that fails — testing only
that the source parses would let a program with type errors, one
`jwc check` exits 1 on, compile to a release binary and run.

The binary listens when the program is a server: it declares a `route` or
a `socket`, or its `main` calls `serve(port)`. A program with neither is a
console program, and the binary returns when `main` does rather than
binding a port behind it.

The two backends are held to the same answers: the release check builds
each real application both ways, runs the same requests against both, and
compares the responses byte for byte — status, content-type, body and
headers.

Anything `jwc build` cannot lower it **refuses**, naming the construct.
A binary that quietly dropped a query would be a far worse outcome than
one that will not build.

The refusals that remain are about a **shape known only at run time**.
`insert into T { ...$req }` and `update T set ...$req` both compile —
which fields the value could carry is its declared `class`, and each
combination of present optional fields becomes its own statement — but a
spread of a local with no declared type does not, and says so by name.

### Watching, and logging what was asked

```bash
jwc serve --watch              # restart on any .jwc change
jwc serve --request-logging    # one line per answered request
```

`--watch` supervises a child `jwc serve` and replaces it whenever a `.jwc`
file under the project changes. It is a restart, not a reload: in-flight
requests are dropped and the pool is re-opened, which is why it is a
development switch and not a deployment one. Only `.jwc` files trigger it —
editing `.env` does not, because the child reads that at boot.

`--request-logging` writes one line per answered request to **stderr**:

```
[jwc] GET /notes/17 -> 200 3.4ms rid=4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736
```

Set `JWC_LOG_FORMAT=json` and each line becomes one JSON object with
`level`, `kind`, `request_id`, `method`, `path`, `status` and `latency_us`.

The request id is the caller's **W3C `traceparent` trace-id** when the
request carries a valid one, so a line here joins the trace the caller
already started. Without one it is a 16-hex-digit id generated by this
process. Either way it goes back as `x-request-id`, whether or not the log
is on — a client cannot turn the switch on, and correlating its report
with a server line is the point.

A native binary has no flags, so the switch there is the environment:

```bash
JWC_REQUEST_LOG=1 ./bin/release/myapp
JWC_REQUEST_LOG=1 jwc serve        # works here too
```

Both backends format the line from one shared source file, so a log
pipeline configured against `jwc serve` reads `jwc build` output unchanged.

## Schema

```bash
jwc migrate new <name>       # diff against the last snapshot
jwc migrate list             # the files on disk, in order — offline
jwc migrate up               # apply what is pending
jwc migrate status           # applied, pending, drifted
jwc migrate verify           # constraints and indexes, by name
jwc migrate down             # roll back, newest first
jwc migrate baseline         # adopt a database that already has the tables
jwc gen-sql                  # the whole schema as DDL, to stdout
```

`migrate list` says what is **written**; `migrate status` says what is
**applied**. Only the second needs a database, which is why the first
answers in a fresh clone with no `DATABASE_URL` — "what does this checkout
contain" is a question you ask before you have a database.

`migrate baseline` is for a database somebody else's tool built — an older
deployment, a hand-written schema. Migrations are snapshot-based, and a
database with no snapshot behind it makes `migrate new` emit `CREATE TABLE`
for tables that already hold rows, so `migrate up` fails on the first one.
Baseline marks every pending migration applied **without running it** and
leaves the database alone. It refuses an empty one, where there is nothing
to adopt and `up` is the command you want.

What it cannot do is fix a name. Postgres calls a bare `PRIMARY KEY (…)`
`link_pkey`; JWC calls it `pk_link`, because the runtime maps a violated
constraint back to its message by name. Baseline lists those differences
instead of refusing over them — every adopted database has some — and the
reconciling `ALTER TABLE … RENAME CONSTRAINT` is yours to write and run
once, with `migrate verify` as the checklist. It does not belong in
`migrations/`: a database built by `migrate up` already has the right
names, and the rename would fail there.

## Seeing what the compiler sees

```bash
jwc routes                   # method, path, middleware chain
jwc explain                  # every query, with the SQL it lowers to
jwc openapi > openapi.json   # OpenAPI 3.1 for the route table
jwc openapi --compact        # one line, no indentation
jwc ast                      # the parsed AST — a debugging aid
```

`jwc openapi` reads the types the checker already inferred rather than
re-deriving them. One type engine, one answer: a route returning
`json(OrgService.get(...))` documents a shape rather than shrugging.

```bash
jwc swagger                  # a browsable reference on http://127.0.0.1:8099
jwc swagger --port 9000
jwc swagger --out api.html   # the page as one file, instead of serving
```

`jwc swagger` renders the same document `jwc openapi` emits — there is
one generator, not two. The page is self-contained: no CDN, no vendored
Swagger UI, so `--out` gives you a single file that opens offline and can
be committed or published as is. It listens on loopback only; an
unauthenticated description of every endpoint does not belong on a
network interface.

`jwc routes` is the fastest way to answer "why is this endpoint 404" and
"which middleware actually runs here".

## Lints

```bash
jwc lint                     # check, plus the advisory whole-program lints
jwc lint --constraints       # every constraint each route can reach
jwc lint --deny-warnings     # the CI shape
jwc lint --json              # one JSON array on stdout, for editors and CI
jwc lint --list-codes          # every diagnostic the spec documents
jwc lint --explain E0211       # one of them, with the spec file that defines it
```

`--list-codes` and `--explain` read no sources, so they answer outside a
project — which is the point: you look a code up when you have one in front
of you, not when you have a checkout. The table is generated from
`docs/spec/v1/*.md` at build time, so it cannot fall behind the spec.

`--json` prints every diagnostic — warnings included — as one array:

```json
[{"file":"/p/a.jwc","line":2,"column":27,"end_line":2,"end_column":31,
  "severity":"error","code":"E0211","message":"unknown name `totl`",
  "note":"declare it with `let`, …","spec":"names.md §5.3"}]
```

The array is on stdout and the verdict is the exit code, so a CI step reads
one and the shell reads the other.

## Packages

```bash
jwc add <name>                 # fetch, vendor, and record as a dependency
jwc add <name>@1.2.3           # a specific version
jwc install                    # fetch every declared dependency that is missing
jwc update                     # move within the recorded ranges
jwc update -p redis            # just this one
jwc remove <name>              # drop it from the manifest and from disk
jwc tree                       # declared, vendored, and at which version
jwc login --token jwc_...      # store a registry key
jwc publish                    # upload this package
```

Dependencies are **vendored**, under `jwc_packages/`. There is no lockfile
and no resolver: `jwcproj.json` records a range, `jwc_packages/<name>/`
holds the sources that range resolved to, and those sources compile with
your program. Which of the two you commit is your call — the templates
gitignore the directory, which is why `jwc install` exists.

`jwc install` is the command a fresh clone needs, and it is safe to put in
a build script: it fetches only what is missing, and it follows a
package's own dependencies. `--force` re-downloads everything.

`jwc update` moves within the range the manifest already records: `^0.2.1`
reaches the newest `0.2.x` and never `0.3.0`. Crossing a major is
`jwc add <name>@<version>` — a change to the requirement, and one that
shows up in the diff as such. An unparseable range is an error, not a
silent "take the newest".

`jwc remove` and `jwc tree` never touch the network.

## Editors

```bash
jwc lsp                        # the language server, LSP over stdio
```

Diagnostics, go-to-definition, hover and completion, from the same
front-end `jwc check` uses — so the editor and the build never disagree.
See [Editor setup](../getting-started/editor-setup.md).

## Which build is this?

```bash
jwc --version              # jwc 1.0.0-rc.2
jwc --version --verbose    # ...plus the triple, profile, commit and rustc
```

```
jwc 1.0.0-rc.2
build target:  x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
build profile: release
git commit:    629ee9d3eaa2
rustc 1.94.1 (e408947bf 2026-03-25)
```

The long form is the first line of a useful bug report.
