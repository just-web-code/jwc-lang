# Hello world

## The actual smallest one

```jwc no-compile
function main() {
    console.writeln("Hello, World!");
}
```

```bash
jwc run app.jwc
```

One file, no manifest, no database, no server. `jwc run` calls `main()`
and exits.

That is worth knowing before the rest of this page, because JWC is a
language for HTTP backends over Postgres and everything below assumes one
— but "everything below" is not the price of printing a line.

## The smallest useful one

The rest of this page builds what JWC is actually for: a table, a route
over it, and `main`.

## The project

```bash
mkdir hello && cd hello
mkdir src
```

`jwcproj.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "hello",
  "type": "app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "entry": "src/app.jwc"
}
```

`src/app.jwc`:

```jwc
namespace app;

database App : Postgres;
schema hello of App;

table Greetings of App.hello {
    id      bigint primary key identity;
    who     varchar(80);
    said_at timestamptz default now();
}

class NewGreeting {
    who varchar(80) required, minLength(1);
}

routes "/greetings" {
    route GET "" {
        return json(select G from App.hello.Greetings
            as { G.id, G.who, G.said_at }
            orderby G.said_at desc, G.id desc
            limit 50);
    }

    route POST "" {
        let req = request.body() as NewGreeting;

        return created(json(insert Greetings into App.hello.Greetings { ...@req }
            as { Greetings.id, Greetings.who, Greetings.said_at }));
    }
}

function main() {
    serve();
}
```

The namespace has to match the path: `src/app.jwc` is `namespace app;`. A
mismatch is `W0102`.

## Create the schema

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://jwc:jwc@localhost:5432/app

jwc migrate new init     # writes migrations/0001_init.{up,down}.sql
jwc migrate up --create-db   # creates the database, then applies it
jwc migrate verify       # every constraint and index is where it should be
```

Drop `--create-db` once the database exists; `createdb app` is the same
step by hand. A name with a capital in it has to be quoted —
`createdb "MyApp"` — because an unquoted `CREATE DATABASE MyApp` is folded
to `myapp` while the name in the URL is not.

On Windows, `export` is not a command — PowerShell sets it like this:

```powershell
$env:DATABASE_URL = "postgres://jwc:jwc@localhost:5432/app"
```

Or put the line in a `.env` beside the project, without `export`, and
every `jwc` command reads it.

Read `migrations/0001_init.up.sql` before applying it. It is ordinary DDL,
generated so you can review it — not a black box.

## Run it

```bash
jwc serve
# 2 routes
# listening on http://localhost:8080  (bound to 0.0.0.0 — every interface)
```

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/greetings \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"who":"dunyo"}'
# {"id":1,"who":"dunyo","said_at":"2026-08-21T09:30:00.000000+00:00"}

curl localhost:8080/greetings
# [{"id":1,"who":"dunyo","said_at":"…"}]
```

Send a bad body and you get every problem at once, not the first:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/greetings \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"who":""}'
# 400
# {"error":"validation_failed","fields":[
#   {"path":"who","rule":"minLength","limit":1,"message":"who kamida 1 belgidan iborat bo'lishi kerak"}]}
```

## Three endpoints you did not write

The runtime serves these at fixed names, so an operator can reach them
without reading your source:

| Path | Answers |
|---|---|
| `/healthz` | `{"status":"ok"}` — liveness; touches nothing |
| `/readyz` | round-trips every configured dependency, and names the one that failed |
| `/metrics` | Prometheus gauges for the connection pools |

A route you declare at one of those paths wins. A wildcard that merely spans
one does not — see [config](../backend/config).
